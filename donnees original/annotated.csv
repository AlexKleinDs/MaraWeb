One hundred and twenty insufficiently active adults were recruited from an ambulatory hospital clinic and randomised to an intervention group that received an education session and five 20-min telephone sessions of PA coaching, or to a control group that received the education session only. ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers were used to measure moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at baseline, post-intervention (3-months) and follow-up (9-months). Secondary outcome measures (anthropometrics, PA self-efficacy, and health-related quality of life) were also assessed at the three time points. At baseline, the mean age and body mass index of participants were 53 ± 8 years and 31 ± 4 kg/m 2 , respectively. Relative to control, the intervention group increased objectively measured MVPA at post-intervention (p < 0.001) and 9 months follow-up (p < 0.001). At the 9-month follow-up the intervention group completed 22 min/day of MVPA (95% CI: 20 to 25 min/day), which is sufficient to meet the recommended PA guidelines. The intervention group exhibited beneficial changes in body mass (p < 0.001), waist circumference (p < 0.001), body mass index (p < 0.001), PA self-efficacy (p < 0.001), and health-related quality of life (p < 0.001) at the 9-month follow-up. This study demonstrates that a low contact PA coaching intervention results in beneficial changes in PA, anthropometrics and health-related outcomes in insufficiently active adults presenting to an ambulatory care clinic. The significant beneficial changes were measured at post-intervention and the 9-month follow-up, demonstrating a maintenance effect of the intervention.

A Tai Chi program has been specifically modified for older people with cognitive impairments by the research team. We aim to assess the effects of this Tai Chi program on mild dementia. Eighty older people with mild dementia were recruited and randomly assigned to a Tai Chi group or a control group. The Tai Chi group practiced the Tai Chi program three times a week for 10 months, while the control group continued receiving routine treatments. All participants were assessed for cognitive function, behavior/mood, and activities of daily living at baseline, 5 months, and 10 months. The Tai Chi group performed better than the control group. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant group×time interaction in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Further analysis of sub-items of the MoCA showed a significant time effect in naming and abstraction. It was statistically significant in both main effect of time and group×time interaction in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Paired sample t test showed the Tai Chi group scored lower at 5 and 10 months in the NPI and at 10 months in the GDS compared with baseline. The Tai Chi group scored lower than the control group at 10 months in the NPI and GDS. The results suggest this Tai Chi program may help improve cognitive function and mental well-being for older adults with mild dementia.|[{'npi': 'tai chi', 'out': 'well-being', 'dis': 'Depression', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'tai chi', 'out': 'cognitive function', 'dis': 'Depression', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'well-being', 'dis': 'Depression', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cognitive function', 'dis': 'Depression', 'eff': 3}]

Yoga is a mind-body discipline that has shown promise for alleviating cancer pain, but few studies have included patients with metastatic disease or examined the acute effects of yoga practice. To determine whether daily pain changed significantly during a randomized controlled trial of the Mindful Yoga program among women with MBC and whether time spent in yoga practice was related to daily pain. On alternate weeks during the intervention period, we collected daily measures of pain from a subset of 48 women randomized to either yoga (n = 30) or a support group condition (n = 18). We also assessed daily duration of yoga practice among patients randomized to yoga. Pain levels were low for women in both conditions, and no differential treatment effects were found on daily pain. However, among women randomized to yoga, a dose/response relationship was found between yoga practice duration and daily pain. When patients had spent relatively more time practicing yoga across two consecutive days, they were more likely to experience lower pain on the next day. This finding is consistent with an earlier MBC study. Meditation practice showed the strongest association with lower daily pain. Findings suggest that yoga practice (meditation practice in particular) is associated with acute improvements in cancer pain, and that yoga interventions may be more impactful if tested in a sample of patients with advanced cancer in which pain is relatively elevated.|[{'npi': 'meditation', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'yoga', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}]

These complexities are perpetuated through media and discourse. Purpose: Using a feminist post-structural approach and photovoice, this study explored health, physical activity, and nutrition in adolescent girls and young women. Methods: Photovoice enables reflection, promotes dialogue, and sparks change. The process involved conducting a workshop, collecting photos, and participatory analysis sessions, which engaged the participants (n = 7, ages 13-26) in photo selection, contextualization, and codifying. Results: This resulted in three themes: First, (Breaking) Stereotypes, in which participants identified gender norms, conflicts, and contradictions; Second, Emotional Safety, or the contexts in which girls and young women feel confident and comfortable; Finally, Being Outside in Nature emerged as significant. Each theme is supported by quotations and photographs. This work suggests being outside in nature provides important context for girls and young women to feel emotionally safe, such that they may engage in the complex navigation of competing discourses surrounding health.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}]

We compared the impact of a similar energy deficit prescription by CR or by CR combined with PA on total fat mass, epicardial fat thickness, and cardiometabolic profile in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In this 16-week randomized controlled study, 73 individuals were randomly enrolled to receive: 1) a monthly motivational phone call (Control), 2) a caloric deficit of -700 kilocalories/day (CR), or 3) a caloric deficit of -500 kilocalories/day combined with a PA program of -200 kilocalories/day (CR&PA). Total fat mass, epicardial fat, and cardiometabolic profile were measured at baseline and after 16 weeks. While comparable weight loss occurred in both intervention groups (-3.9 ± 3.5 kg [CR], -5.1 ± 4.7 kg [CR&PA], -0.2 ± 2.9 kg [Control]), changes in total fat mass were significantly different between all groups (-2.4 ± 2.9 kg [CR], -4.5 ± 3.4 kg [CR&PA], +0.1 ± 2.1 kg [Control]; p < 0.05) as well as epicardial fat thickness (-0.4 ± 1.6 mm [CR], -1.4 ± 1.4 mm [CR&PA], +1.1 ± 1.3 mm [Control]; p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in trends for cardiometabolic parameters improvement between groups. For a similar energy deficit prescription and comparable weight loss, the combination of CR&PA provides a greater reduction in fat mass and epicardial fat thickness than CR alone in individuals with comparable weight loss and with a similar energy deficit prescription. These results, however, do not translate into significant improvements in cardiometabolic profiles. CLINICALTRIALS.

Veterinary students face demanding schedules and potentially high rates of psychological distress. Though veterinary students' strategies for healthy eating have been explored, factors influencing their ability to achieve a healthy diet are less understood. This study assesses incoming veterinary students' perceived attitudes to their dietary habits and physical activity levels. Incoming students ( n = 322) at five Canadian and five randomly selected US veterinary schools completed a questionnaire inquiring about demographic information, dietary attitudes and habits, and activity levels. More than half (58%) of students perceived their diet to be moderately healthy . A desire to feel better and have more energy was the most reported (79%) motivating factor to modifying personal eating habits and was significantly associated with improved odds of having a perceived healthy diet ( OR = 2.22, p < .024). A busy lifestyle was perceived as a barrier to changing current eating habits by 92% of respondents. Students reporting a desire to maintain their health ( OR = 3.42, p < .001) and moderate ( OR = 2.81, p < .003) or high ( OR = 2.30, p < .044) routine physical activity levels were also more likely to perceive their diet as healthy . Findings show that incoming veterinary students' perceptions may influence their goals of achieving a healthy lifestyle. An understanding of incoming veterinary students' barriers and motivators could be applied in future research to assist students in achieving personalized goals.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'psychological distress', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'diet', 'out': 'stress', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'diet', 'out': 'psychological distress', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'diet', 'out': 'well-being', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'stress', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'well-being', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'healthy diet', 'out': 'stress', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'healthy diet', 'out': 'psychological distress', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'healthy diet', 'out': 'well-being', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}]

We systematically reviewed the resistance training effects in prostate cancer patients to determine the minimal dosage regarding the exercise components (type, duration, volume, and intensity) on body composition, physical function, muscle strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, body mass index, and prostate-specific antigen. Using PRISMA guidelines, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science databases were searched. Eligible randomized controlled trials examined prostate cancer patients undertaking resistance-based exercise programs during or after treatment. Meta-analysis was undertaken when more than three studies were included. Associations between mean differences and exercise components were tested by univariate and multivariate meta-regression analysis. Twenty-three articles describing 21 trials and involving 1748 prostate cancer patients were included. Exercise improved fat mass (-1% in body fat and -0.6 kg in fat mass), lean mass (~0.5 kg in lean and appendicular lean mass), functional capacity (i.e., chair rise, 400-m test, 6-m fast walk, and stair climb tests), and fitness outcomes (i.e., V̇O2peak and muscle strength) (P = 0.040-<0.001) with no change in body mass index or prostate-specific antigen (P = 0.440-0.735). Meta-regression indicated no association between exercise type, resistance training duration, weekly volume and intensity, and primary outcomes (P = 0.075-0.965). There was a significant association between exercise intensity and chest press muscle strength (favoring moderate intensity, P = 0.012), but not in other secondary outcomes. In untrained older men with prostate cancer initiating an exercise program, lower volume at moderate to high intensity is as effective as higher volume resistance training for enhancing body composition, functional capacity, and muscle strength in the short term. A low exercise dosage may help reduce barriers to exercise and enhance adherence.|[{'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'physical functioning', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'fat mass', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'body mass index', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'muscle strength', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'adherence', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'fat mass', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'body mass index', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'physical functioning', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'muscle strength', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'adherence', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}]

The bone-protective effect was maintained for 2 years after the end of the program but was lost thereafter. Breast cancer survivors are at an increased risk for osteoporosis and fracture. This 5-year follow-up of a randomized impact exercise intervention trial evaluated the maintenance of training effects on bone among breast cancer patients. Five hundred seventy-three early breast cancer patients aged 35-68 years and treated with adjuvant therapy were allocated into a 12-month exercise program or a control group. Four hundred forty-four patients (77%) were included in the 5-year analysis. The exercise intervention comprised weekly supervised step aerobics, circuit exercises, and home training. Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Physical activity was estimated in metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week and physical performance assessed by 2-km walking and figure-8 running tests. In premenopausal patients, the 12-month exercise program maintained femoral neck (FN) and total hip (TH) aBMD for 3 years, but the protective effect was lost thereafter. The mean FN aBMD change in the exercise and control groups was - 0.2% and - 1.5% 1 year, - 1.1% and - 2.1% 3 years and - 3.3% versus - 2.4% 5 years after the beginning of the intervention, respectively. Lumbar spine (LS) bone loss was not prevented in premenopausal women and no training effects on aBMD were seen in postmenopausal women. The main confounding element of the study was the unexpected rise in physical activity among patients in the control group. The physical performance improved among premenopausal women in the exercise group compared with the controls. The 12-month exercise program prevented FN and TH bone loss in premenopausal breast cancer patients for 3 years. The bone-protective effect was reversible and lost thereafter.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'bone mineral density', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'bone mineral density', 'dis': 'Osteoporosis', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'bone density', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'bone density', 'dis': 'Osteoporosis', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'physical performance', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'physical performance', 'dis': 'Osteoporosis', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'running', 'out': 'bone mineral density', 'dis': 'Osteoporosis', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'running', 'out': 'bone density', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'running', 'out': 'bone density', 'dis': 'Osteoporosis', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'running', 'out': 'osteoporosis', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'running', 'out': 'osteoporosis', 'dis': 'Osteoporosis', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'running', 'out': 'physical performance', 'dis': 'Osteoporosis', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'bone mineral density', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'bone mineral density', 'dis': 'Osteoporosis', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'bone density', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'bone density', 'dis': 'Osteoporosis', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'osteoporosis', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'physical performance', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'physical performance', 'dis': 'Osteoporosis', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'osteoporosis', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'osteoporosis', 'dis': 'Osteoporosis', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'running', 'out': 'bone mineral density', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'running', 'out': 'physical performance', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'osteoporosis', 'dis': 'Osteoporosis', 'eff': 3}]

Despite the differences in PA level between physically strenuous and inactive work, the literature reporting the effectiveness of the interventions does not usually differentiate physically active and inactive jobs. The aim of the current study was therefore to collect and synthesise research evidence on workplace PA interventions to promote work ability specifically among workers in physically strenuous jobs by means of a scoping review. Methods : The databases Medline, Cochrane Central and Scopus were used to identify interventions to promote work ability by increasing PA among workers in physically strenuous jobs. An iterative method was used to obtain an overview of the study elements and to extract details on the study design, sample, intervention, outcomes and effectiveness. Results : A total of 47 studies evaluating eight categories of interventions were found. Out of these, 18 reported significant effects on work ability. Positive results came from a range of different interventions, including aerobic exercise, strength training, combined aerobic exercise and strength training, stretching, yoga, consultation and tailored physical exercise programmes.  Conclusions : Few interventions were effective in promoting work ability by increasing PA among workers in physically strenuous jobs. In particular, trials based on the demands of work, multimodal interventions and applying wearable technology are needed .|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'work ability', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'yoga', 'out': 'work ability', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'work ability', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}]

We used a large, population-based sample to assess this relationship in men and women with and without chronic pain. We used data from the sixth and seventh Tromsø Study surveys (2007-2008; 2015-2016), with assessed pain tolerance of participants with the cold pressor test (CPT: dominant hand in circulating cold water at 3°C, maximum test time 106 s), and self-reported total amount of habitual PA in leisure time (n = 19,087), exercise frequency (n = 19,388), exercise intensity (n = 18,393) and exercise duration (n = 18,343). A sub-sample had PA measured by accelerometers (n = 4,922). We used Cox regression to compare CPT tolerance times between self-reported PA levels. For accelerometer-measured PA, we estimated hazard ratios for average daily activity counts, and for average daily minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA done in bouts lasting 10 min or more. Models were tested for PA-sex, and PA-chronic pain and PA-moderate-to-severe chronic pain interactions. Leisure-time PA, exercise intensity and exercise duration were positively associated with CPT tolerance (p < .001; p = .011; p < .001). More PA was associated with higher CPT tolerance. At high levels of leisure-time PA and exercise intensity, men had a significantly higher CPT tolerance than women. Accelerometer-measured PA was not associated with CPT tolerance. This study is one of the first to show that higher self-reported habitual PA was connected to higher experimental pain tolerance in a population-based sample, especially for men. This was not found for accelerometer-measured PA. This study finds that higher level of self-reported leisure-time physical activity is associated with increased cold pressor pain tolerance in a large population-based sample. Though present in both sexes, the association is strongest among men. Despite the robust dose-response relationship between pain tolerance and self-reported activity level, no such relationship was found for accelerometer-measured activity, reflecting a possible discrepancy in the aspect of physical activity measured. Though the study design does not permit causal conclusions, the findings suggest that increasing physical activity may increase pain tolerance in the general population.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 1}]

Physical activity promotion is a priority and helps to decrease mortality risk due to cardiovascular diseases. However, adherence to the habitual physical activity prescription in primary healthcare settings is low. Multicentre, single-blind, parallel randomized (in two different branches) clinical trial. In total, 263 participants from 20 primary healthcare centres in Mallorca completed the randomized controlled trial study (intervention group N = 128, control group N = 135). The intervention consisted in four visits and included a motivational interview and an individualized prescription of physical activity using health assets. Primary outcome measure was the number of participants performing at least 150 min of weekly physical activity. Secondary outcomes included physical activity level and physical fitness, Sense of Coherence, cardiovascular risk, sociodemographic data, trans-theoretical stage of change, sleep quality, and depression. Adherence to the recommendation of at least 150 min of physical activity was higher in the intervention than in the control group (χ 2  = 3.951, p = .047). However, this higher adherence did not suppose higher physical activity levels because no differences between groups were found in the total physical activity performed after intervention (t=-0.915, p = .361). At the end of the intervention participants randomized to the intervention group spent more time walking than participants in the control group (t = 2.260, p = .025). The multifactorial intervention performed by primary care nurses induced a higher adherence to the 150-min of weekly physical activity recommendation. Adherence to the usual physical activity prescription in primary care is low. Physical activity prescription performed by primary care nurses and based on health assets and motivational interview can help to increase physical activity levels of patients. The main finding of the present study was that prescription using this approach was shown to be effective, leading to a higher adherence in the intervention group. This intervention is feasible in the nurse's primary healthcare setting, thus it could be implemented as the main tool when exercise is prescribed.

Standing desks have been introduced to minimize the detrimental health effects of prolonged sedentary behavior (SB). The effectiveness of using standing desks has not been explored among undergraduate students - a population showing high SB. Ninety-six undergraduate students were randomly assigned to a sitting or standing tutorial group that ran for nine weeks, and their PAB was monitored using the activPAL3™ triaxial activity monitor. To check for potential compensatory or other covarying behaviors, the students' PAB was monitored on tutorial and non-tutorial days. PAB monitoring was conducted in week 4-5, and a follow-up measurement was conducted in week 9 to examine longer-term effects. In week 4-5, the stand group (n = 41) showed less SB (β = -0.092, SE = 0.044, 95% CI: -0.179, -0.006) and more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (β = 0.320, SE = 0.160, 95% CI: 0.004, 0.635) compared to the sit group (n = 36). On tutorial days, the stand group showed more light physical activity (LPA) than the sit group (p < .001, d = 1.04). In week 9, there was an exam on the last day of that week. Nonetheless, the stand group (n = 37) showed less SB (p < .001, d = 0.378) and more LPA (p = .008, d = 0.725), while breaking up prolonged SB more frequently (p = .007, d = 0.696) on the tutorial day compared to the sit group (n = 32).

This three-arm randomized controlled trial tested the hypotheses that 1) BWL interventions with an intensive focus on exercise would result in higher amounts of MVPA and greater long-term weight loss, compared to standard BWL, and 2) among interventions with an intensive focus on exercise, outcomes would be superior when skills for exercise promotion were taught from an acceptance-based theoretical framework (which fosters willingness to accept discomfort in the service of valued behaviors), versus a traditional behavioral approach. Three hundred and twenty adults with overweight/obesity received group-based BWL for induction of weight loss (Months 1-6) and were randomized to receive one of three interventions for weight loss maintenance (Months 7-18): continued standard behavioral treatment (BT), behavioral treatment with an emphasis on exercise (BT + PA), or acceptance-based treatment with an emphasis on exercise (ABT + PA). MVPA and percent weight loss did not significantly differ by condition at 12 or 18 months. Participants engaging in relatively higher levels of MVPA had greater long-term weight losses compared to participants engaging in lower levels of MVPA. Further clinical innovations are needed so that participants in BWL programs can more readily adopt and maintain the recommended amounts of MVPA.

Owing to severe postoperative pain, knee patients are anticipated to be more limited in performing heavy load exercises than hip patients. The aim of the present study was to describe pain and load progression during early MST in THA and TKA patients. Explorative study based on secondary analyses from two randomized controlled trials: 26 THA and 16 TKA patients had their training sessions logged. They trained at 85-90% of their maximal capacity in leg press, and abduction/knee-extension of the operated leg (4 × 5 repetitions) for 8-10 weeks, initiated early postoperatively. Knee patients experienced significantly more pain than hip patients during the training sessions ( p < 0.03), however, pain before and after training was not different ( p > 0.09). All patients significantly increased leg press training load until the last intervention week ( p < 0.01). This study demonstrates that TKA patients experience more pain than THA patients during training following a MST program but not more than moderate levels during or after training. Pain before and after training is not different. Both groups significantly increased load progression during the intervention. These findings indicate that both THA and TKA patients might perform MST with extensive load progression early after surgery without compromising pain.

Pilot randomized controlled trial. Previously-inactive women aged 18-40 years with PCOS. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment, retention, adherence to exercise and daily ovulation prediction kit (OPK) testing. Preliminary efficacy outcomes included reproductive, anthropometric and cardiometabolic health markers. 47 women were randomized to no-exercise control (n=17), HIIT (n=16), or CAET (n=14). Forty (85%) participants completed the trial. Median exercise adherence was 68% (IQR 53%, 86%). Median daily OPK-testing adherence in the first half of the intervention was 87% (IQR 61%, 97%) compared with 65% (IQR 0%, 96%) in the second half. Body mass index decreased significantly in CAET compared with control (-1.0 kg/m 2 , p=0.01) and HIIT (-0.9 kg/m 2 , p=0.04). Mean waist circumference decreased in all groups (-7.3 cm, -6.9 cm, -4.5 cm in HIIT, CAET and control) with no significant between-group differences. Mean LDL-C was significantly reduced for HIIT compared to CAET (-0.33 mmol/L, p=0.03). HDL-C increased in HIIT compared with control (0.18 mmol/L, p=0.04). There were feasibility challenges with adherence daily ovulation assessment limiting the ability to analyze the effect of the exercise interventions on ovulation. CAET and HIIT were both effective at improving anthropometrics and some cardiometabolic health markers.

Little is known about the efficacy of high-intensity strength training in patients with knee osteoarthritis or whether it may worsen knee symptoms. To determine whether high-intensity strength training reduces knee pain and knee joint compressive forces more than low-intensity strength training and more than attention control in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Assessor-blinded randomized clinical trial conducted at a university research center in North Carolina that included 377 community-dwelling adults (≥50 years) with body mass index (BMI) ranging from 20 to 45 and with knee pain and radiographic knee osteoarthritis. Enrollment occurred between July 2012 and February 2016, and follow-up was completed September 2017. Participants were randomized to high-intensity strength training (n = 127), low-intensity strength training (n = 126), or attention control (n = 124). Primary outcomes at the 18-month follow-up were Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) knee pain (0 best-20 worst; minimally clinically important difference [MCID, 2]) and knee joint compressive force, defined as the maximal tibiofemoral contact force exerted along the long axis of the tibia during walking (MCID, unknown). Among 377 randomized participants (mean age, 65 years; 151 women [40%]), 320 (85%) completed the trial. Mean adjusted (sex, baseline BMI, baseline outcome values) WOMAC pain scores at the 18-month follow-up were not statistically significantly different between the high-intensity group and the control group (5.1 vs 4.9; adjusted difference, 0.2; 95% CI, -0.6 to 1.1; P = .61) or between the high-intensity and low-intensity groups (5.1 vs 4.4; adjusted difference, 0.7; 95% CI, -0.1 to 1.6; P = .08). Mean knee joint compressive forces were not statistically significantly different between the high-intensity group and the control group (2453 N vs 2512 N; adjusted difference, -58; 95% CI, -282 to 165 N; P = .61), or between the high-intensity and low-intensity groups (2453 N vs 2475 N; adjusted difference, -21; 95% CI, -235 to 193 N; P = .85). There were 87 nonserious adverse events (high-intensity, 53; low-intensity, 30; control, 4) and 13 serious adverse events unrelated to the study (high-intensity, 5; low-intensity, 3; control, 5). Among patients with knee osteoarthritis, high-intensity strength training compared with low-intensity strength training or an attention control did not significantly reduce knee pain or knee joint compressive forces at 18 months. The findings do not support the use of high-intensity strength training over low-intensity strength training or an attention control in adults with knee osteoarthritis.

We enrolled 40 BCS (M age = 57.33 ± 8.75), M BMI = 27.38 ± 5.27, M fatigue = 4.56 ± 1.81 as measured by the Piper Fatigue Scale. More favorable post-intervention evaluations were reported by the combined group, compared to aerobic exercise or relaxation only (p < 0.05). Reductions in fatigue favoring the combined group (p = 0.05) showed a modest effect size (Cohen's d = 0.91) compared to aerobic exercise only. These findings provide preliminary evidence for the feasibility of combining evidence-based techniques to address fatigue among BCS. The combined approach, incorporating mobile health technology, presents an efficacious and well-received design.

To investigate the effect of different exercise intensities on total volume of physical activity and energy intake amongst active men with overweight. Young men with overweight from a naval academy (n = 72; mean ± SD, age 21 ± 2 years, BMI 27.9 ± 2.13 kg/m 2 ) were randomised to a control group (CG), moderate-intensity (MEG), or vigorous-intensity exercise group (VEG). MEG and VEG performed exercise sessions three times per week, for 60 min, during a 2-week period. Physical activity was assessed using triaxial accelerometers for 13 days. Energy intake was assessed at four time-points by 24-hour food recall. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed using linear mixed effect models. MEG and VEG presented a greater compensatory effect in the total volume of physical activity over time compared to CG, with a significant difference in the rate of change between VEG and CG (∆ = -250,503 counts vs. ∆ = -61,306 counts, respectively; p = 0.01), and MEG and CG (∆ = -253,336 counts vs. ∆ = -61,306 counts, respectively; p = 0.01). There was no difference between MEG and VEG (p = 0.97). Changes in energy intake were not different between groups (p = 0.18); however, MEG presented greater energy intake compared to CG (β=491 kcal/day; p = 0.01) and VEG (β=319 kcal/day; p = 0.07). VEG presented a greater reduction in body weight compared to MEG (-1.3 kg vs. -0.4 kg; p = 0.03) and CG (-1.3 kg vs. -0.6 kg; p = 0.07). Two weeks of exercise promoted a compensatory effect in total volume of physical activity in active men with overweight, regardless of exercise intensity. The compensatory effect was not observed for energy intake, although there was a trend for higher absolute energy intake in the MEG. Consequently, individuals in the VEG showed greater reduction in body weight over the intervention period.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight loss', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'exercise interventions', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'exercise interventions', 'out': 'weight loss', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}]

Children were randomly assigned to a PA intervention or a wait-list control group and completed a task that manipulated inhibitory control, while task performance and neuroelectric (P3 component) outcomes were assessed. About 103 children with OB were matched to a sample of 103 normal weight (NW) children based on treatment allocation and demographic variables. Children with OB in the control group demonstrated reduced P3 amplitude from pre- to post-test, meanwhile those with OB in the PA intervention maintained P3 amplitude at post-test compared to pre-test. Additionally, NW children in the PA intervention group showed that decreased visceral adipose tissue corresponded with faster task performance, a relationship not observed in children with OB. These results suggest that a 9-month PA intervention may be particularly beneficial to the cognitive and brain health of children with OB.

The 6-month exercise intervention included supervised resistance training and home-based endurance training. CRF was assessed by Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI, five subscales score range 4-20), and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scale (FACIT-F, score range 0-52). Multiple linear regression for main factorial effects was performed according to intention-to-treat, with post-intervention CRF as primary endpoint. Overall, 577 participants (mean age 58.7 years) were randomized. Participants randomized to high- vs low-to-moderate-intensity exercise had lower physical fatigue (MFI Physical Fatigue subscale; mean difference -1.05 [95% CI: -1.85, -0.25]), but the difference was not clinically important (ie <2). We found no differences in other CRF dimensions and no effect of additional BCS. There were few minor adverse events. For CRF, patients undergoing (neo-)adjuvant treatment for breast, prostate or colorectal cancer can safely exercise at high- or low-to-moderate intensity, according to their own preferences. Additional BCS does not provide extra benefit for CRF in supervised, well-controlled exercise interventions.|[{'npi': 'endurance training', 'out': 'fatigue', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'fatigue', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'exercise interventions', 'out': 'fatigue', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'fatigue', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}]

This pilot-randomized controlled trial was conducted on 57 participants receiving chemotherapy for HNC. The participants were randomized into an exercise group and a control group. The exercise group received moderate-intensity combined aerobic, resistance and flexibility exercises three times a week for eight weeks during chemotherapy. The control group received no specific information regarding exercise. The outcome measures including body composition, muscle strength, balance, flexibility, cardiovascular fitness and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) were assessed at baseline and eight weeks following baseline. The body composition (body fat percentage, p = 0.002; skeletal muscle percentage, p = 0.008), dynamic balance ( p = 0.01), muscle strength (upper extremity, p = 0.037; lower extremity, p = 0.025) and HRQoL ( p = 0.001) showed a significant difference between the exercise group and the control group eight weeks following baseline. Significant deteriorations were noted in flexibility, muscle strength, cardiovascular fitness and several domains of HRQoL scale in the control group at eight weeks following baseline. This study found that a combined aerobic, resistance and flexibility exercise program during chemotherapy may improve physical fitness (i.e., muscle strength, balance, flexibility and body composition) and HRQoL and alleviate the deterioration of cardiovascular fitness in patients with HNC.

A lower proportion of patients in the triamcinolone acetonide plus resistance band training bands group than in the triamcinolone acetonide group had received re-treatment at one-year follow-up (12.1% vs 82.9%). Progressive resistance training with resistance (elastic) bands has the advantages of extending the benefits of corticosteroid injection and maintaining long-term effects on shoulder function in patients with subacromial bursitis.|[{'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'range of motion', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'muscle strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'proprioception', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'range of motion', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'muscle strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'proprioception', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}]

HFpEF patients are frequently concomitant with AF, but whether PA could modify the risk of AF in HFpEF patients remains undiscovered. We performed a post hoc analysis of the TOPCAT trial. Patients without AF at baseline and with data on PA (n = 652) were included. The association between PA and risk of AF occurrence was explored using the Cox proportional hazard model. During a median follow-up of 2.84 years, 9.4% of the studied patients (n = 60) had an occurrence of AF. When PA was analyzed as a continuous variable, every ten-fold increase of PA was associated with a 42.8% risk reduction of AF occurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 0.572, 95% CI 0.357-0.916, p = 0.020). When HFpEF patients were divided into three tertile groups according to PA levels, patients in the second tertile (HR 0.507, 95% CI 0.272-0.946, p = 0.033) and the third tertile (HR 0.487, 95% CI 0.261-0.908, p = 0.024) had significantly lower risks of AF occurrence when compared to those in the first tertile. Our current results suggest that a higher PA level associates with a lower risk of AF in HFpEF patients. URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov.

Forty-four BCS (60.3 ± 8.3 yr) were randomly assigned to the FIT or yin yoga group. Body composition and BMD were measured via dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Blood biomarkers for bone metabolism were analyzed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Upper and lower body strength was assessed using a one-repetition maximum chest press and isokinetic knee extension/flexion using the Biodex System 3, respectively. Participants completed 45-min FIT or yin yoga sessions twice weekly for 24 wk. Changes in dependent variables over time were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Significance was accepted at P ≤ 0.05. There were no group-time effects for body composition, BMD, or blood biomarkers. Main effects were observed for left femoral neck (0.883 ± 0.138 to 0.870 ± 0.131 g·cm) and left forearm (0.465 ± 0.078 to 0.457 ± 0.069 g·cm) BMD. The FIT group improved upper body strength (73.2 ± 18.1 to 83.2 ± 22.3 kg), whereas the yin yoga group did not (59.8 ± 14.8 to 59.3 ± 15.6 kg). Main time effects were observed for peak isokinetic knee extension and flexion at all speeds with an average improvement of 13.2% and 16.2%, respectively. Both FIT and yin yoga may be beneficial exercise modes for improving lower body strength, although only FIT improved upper body strength. Additional research is needed to examine the effectiveness of FIT programs of longer duration and/or higher intensity on body composition and BMD in BCS.|[{'npi': 'yoga', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}]

Therefore, we investigate the effect of low-intensity resistance training alone or in combination with a compression garment on lymphedema volume, self-reported lymphedema symptoms, and shoulder mobility and function. A total of 60 women with unilateral BCRL were randomly assigned to low-intensity resistance exercises (Rex group, n = 30) or exercises and compression garment (Rex-Com-group, n = 30). Both groups take part in exercises program consisted of 10-12 repetitions at 50 to 60% of one repetition maximum (IRM), three times weekly, for 8 weeks. The primary outcome was lymphedema volume determined by percentage reduction of excess limb volume (ELV). Secondary outcomes were lymphedema symptoms (pain, heaviness, and tightness) and shoulder mobility and function using the disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand (DASH) questionnaire. All measurements were standardized and performed before (week 0, W0), after the intervention (week 8, W8), and at follow-up (week 12, W12). A significant reduction in percentage of ELV (p < 0.01), pain severity (p < 0.05), a sensation of heaviness (p < 0.05) and tightness (p < 0.001), and improvement in shoulder range of motion (p < 0.05) and function on DASH scores (p < 0.05) were observed at W8 and W12 in both groups. However, no between-group differences were observed over time. These findings suggest that low-intensity resistance training, irrespective of garment use, can effectively reduce limb volume and lymphedema symptoms, and increase shoulder mobility and function.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'range of motion', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'lymphedema', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'lymphedema', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'range of motion', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'compression garments', 'out': 'lymphedema', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'compression garments', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'compression garments', 'out': 'range of motion', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}]

The aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the effects of small-sided team handball training on lower limb muscle strength, postural balance and body composition in young adults. Twenty-six men and twenty-eight women were stratified for peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) and body fat percentage and randomly allocated to either 12 wks of small-sided recreational team handball training (THG: 14 men and 14 women, age 24.1±2.6 yrs (mean±SD), VO2peak 39.8±5.9 ml/kg/min and body fat percentage 32.7±8.7%) or serving as non-exercising controls (CON: 12 men and 14 women, age 24.8±3.1 yrs, VO2peak 39.7±5.0 ml/kg/min, body fat percentage 31.7±9.7%). THG trained on average 1.8 times/week for 12 wks. At 0 and 12 wks, lower limb muscle strength, rate of force development (RFD), vertical jump height and power, postural balance, body composition and muscle biopsies were assessed. No training effects were observed for maximal isokinetic or isometric knee extensor strength, maximal vertical jump height or take-off power, fibre type distribution or capillarization. Late phase (RFD) increased (+7.4%, p<0.05) and postural sway excursion length was improved after training (-9%, p<0.05) in THG with no difference from CON (p>0.05). Further, THG demonstrated a decrease in body fat percentage (-3.7%) accompanied by increases in whole-body fat free mass (FFM) (+2.2%), leg FFM (+2.5%), total bone mineral content (BMC) (+1.1%), leg BMC (+1.2%), total hip bone mineral density (+1.6%) and hip T-score (+50%) which differed from CON (all p<0.05). In conclusion, recreational small-sided team handball training appears to effectively improve rapid force capacity, postural balance, lean and fat body mass and bone health in previously untrained young adults.

To examine the effect of a progressive, moderate-to-high intensity AET program on memory and executive function, brain volume, and cortical amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque deposition in aMCI patients. This is a proof-of-concept trial that randomized 70 aMCI patients to 12 months of AET or stretching and toning (SAT, active control) interventions. Primary neuropsychological outcomes were assessed by using the California Verbal Learning Test-second edition (CVLT-II) and the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS). Secondary outcomes were the global and hippocampal brain volumes and the mean cortical and precuneus Aβ deposition. Baseline cognitive scores were similar between the groups. Memory and executive function performance improved over time but did not differ between the AET and SAT groups. Brain volume decreased and precuneus Aβ plaque deposition increased over time but did not differ between the groups. Cardiorespiratory fitness was significantly improved in the AET compared with SAT group. In amyloid positive patients, AET was associated with reduced hippocampal atrophy when compared with the SAT group. The AET and SAT groups both showed evidence of slightly improved neuropsychological scores in previously sedentary aMCI patients. However, these interventions did not prevent brain atrophy or increases in cortical Aβ deposition over 12 months. In amyloid positive patients, AET reduced hippocampal atrophy when compared with the SAT group.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'memory', 'dis': 'Alzheimer Disease', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'executive function', 'dis': 'Alzheimer Disease', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'memory', 'dis': 'Alzheimer Disease', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'executive function', 'dis': 'Alzheimer Disease', 'eff': 3}]

A secondary analysis of data from a group randomized trial including 24 schools (12 intervention and 12 control; N = 1519 girls) was conducted. Age, ethnicity, race, socioeconomic status, and pubertal stage were assessed via survey. Height, weight, MVPA (min/h), percent body fat, and CRF were measured. Mixed-effects linear models were performed. Compared to the control, the intervention increased overweight and obese girls' CRF (b = 0.28, p = 0.049; b = 0.31, p < 0.01, respectively), but not healthy weight girls' CRF (b = 0.04, p = 0.706). Pre- to mid-puberty girls in the intervention group had slightly lower post-intervention MVPA than those in the control (3.04 vs. 3.31, p = 0.055), while late to post-puberty intervention and control girls' post-intervention MVPA was similar (3.12 vs. 3.04, p = 0.542). A PA intervention can improve overweight and obese girls' CRF, possibly attenuating their cardiovascular risk. Effective strategies are needed to assist adolescent girls, especially those in pre- to mid-puberty, in maintaining their MVPA after an intervention ends. Moderators of physical activity intervention effects among adolescent girls are important to identify because the effectiveness of these interventions to date in this population has been limited. This article contributes to the notable gap in knowledge regarding moderators in physical activity interventions involving adolescent girls, particularly baseline characteristics that may moderate their responses to physical activity interventions. Awareness of the moderators can be useful for determining the type of intervention that may be successful in subgroups of adolescent girls and for tailoring a physical activity intervention to optimally meet each girl's needs to achieve maximal effects. Findings show that weight status moderated the intervention effects on cardiorespiratory fitness. Compared to the control condition, the intervention increased overweight and obese, but not healthy weight, girls' cardiorespiratory fitness. A physical activity intervention can improve overweight and obese girls' cardiorespiratory fitness, possibly attenuating their cardiovascular risk. Therefore, it is essential to include overweight and obese girls in PA interventions to help them reap this important benefit.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cardiovascular risk', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 2}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cardiovascular risk', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 2}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 2}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 2}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'body mass index', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 2}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'body mass index', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 2}]

Participants were randomly assigned to either AE or basic stretching activities (control), which took place 3x/week for 6 weeks. Primary outcome was depression severity as assessed with the HDRS-17 and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Further physiological and psychological variables and cognitive performance were assessed as secondary outcomes. Forty-two patients were included in the analysis (exercise: n = 22; control: n = 20). Regardless of group allocation, we found a significant short-term time effect for symptom-severity (HDRS17: p<0.001, η²=0.70; BDI: p<0.001, η²=0.51), mental toughness (p<0.001, η²=0.32), physical self-description endurance score (p = 0.013, η²=0.16), cognitive flexibility (p = 0.013, η²=0.14), and body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.006, η²=0.19).

Self-reported QoL data was collected using a 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) questionnaire; further physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) component scores were derived. Effect of exercise was evaluated using randomized study of 110 PWE, divided into control and exercise groups of 55 each. At baseline, mean age of study population was 25.85±9.62years with 77 (44.5%) women. Average body mass index (BMI) was 29.33±6.17kg/m 2 . Mean PCS and MCS were 45.95±7.92 and 45.72±10.40 respectively. In 124 (71.7%) PWE with obesity, while high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) (46.10±12.32 vs. 39.30±10.39mg/dL; p<.001) was lower, low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) (101.60±37.51 vs. 113.89±32.65mg/dL; p=.035) was high. Both the randomized groups were comparable for type and number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used. At 12-week follow-up, PWE in the exercise group reduced 7.65±5.62kg while control group gained an average of 4.01±4.74kg (p<.001).

Participants were randomized 2:1 to AE (36 forty-minute sessions conducted 3 times per week over 12 weeks) versus a non-aerobic stretching exercise condition conducted under the same regimen and timeframe. Cardiorespiratory fitness improved significantly within the AE group (p<.0001), and differed significantly from the comparison group (p<.02; Cohen's d=.41). Trend-level improvements were seen in social functioning within the AE group (p<.09) and showed a similar trend level difference in the between-group comparison (p<.06; Cohen's d=.35). Improvements in social functioning were significantly related to gains in cardiorespiratory fitness (r=.42; p<.01). AE effects on other physical and mental health indices were also examined. Overall, the AE intervention was well-tolerated, safe, and showed low rates of attrition after the commencement of training. Our findings indicate it is feasible to improve cardiorespiratory fitness in this clinical population, and there is suggestive evidence that the interventions aimed to do so may also benefit social functioning.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'social functioning', 'dis': 'Schizophrenia', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'social functioning', 'dis': 'Schizophrenia', 'eff': 3}]

Sixty overweight women with metabolic syndrome were assigned equally into four groups: AE, RE, CE, and control. The study variables were measured before and 24 h after the intervention period. None of the study groups showed statistically significant changes in the serum irisin. However, muscle mass significantly increased in the RE and CE groups. Also, a significant decrease was observed in the body fat percentage in all groups. In addition, compared with the control group, the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance in the AE (p = 0.021), RE (p = 0.039), and in the CE (p = 0.003) groups reduced significantly. According to the analysis of indices' changes, serum irisin was significantly correlated with the body fat percentage (r = 0.532) and HOMA-IR (r = 0.424). The systematic exercise program for 8-weeks did not change circulating irisin and no statistically significant difference was observed between the exercise methods.

This study aimed to identify the immediate effects of pedaling exercises on stiff-knee gait from a kinesiophysiological perspective. Twenty-one patients with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis and stiff-knee gait were randomly assigned to a pedaling group and a walking group. An ergometer was set at a load of 5 Nm and rotation speed of 40 rpm, and gait was performed at a comfortable speed; both the groups performed the intervention for 10 min. Kinematic and electromyographical data while walking on flat surfaces were immediately measured before and after the intervention. In the pedaling group, activity of the rectus femoris significantly decreased from the pre-swing phase to the early swing phase during gait after the intervention. Flexion angles and flexion angular velocities of the knee and hip joints significantly increased during the same period. The pedaling group showed increased step length on the paralyzed side and gait velocity. Pedaling increases knee flexion during the swing phase in hemiparetic patients with stiff-knee gait and improves gait ability.|[{'npi': 'bicycling', 'out': 'velocity', 'dis': 'Stroke', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'velocity', 'dis': 'Stroke', 'eff': 3}]

While undergoing chemotherapy for carcinoma management, women encounter side effects, which affects their quality of life (QOL). A randomized controlled study with quantitative research approach and time series design was conducted, to study the effectiveness of yoga on QOL of breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. One hundred breast cancer patients scheduled for 3-weekly, day-care adjuvant chemotherapy (CEF regimen) were enrolled with consecutive sampling technique, into control ( n = 52) and experiment ( n = 48) groups, by concealed randomization following written informed consent. Baseline data on QOL were collected before first-cycle chemotherapy using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ C30. Patients in the experimental group were taught diaphragmatic breathing techniques, systematic relaxation, and alternate nostril breathing, and Joints and Glands neck and shoulder exercises were instructed to practice twice daily at home. They were supervised in practicing these techniques while they received second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cycles of chemotherapy in the day-care facility. Participants in the control group received only routine care. All participants received standard post chemotherapy prescription. Data on QOL were collected from all patients during the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cycles of chemotherapy. The analysis revealed that at the baseline (first chemotherapy cycle), breast cancer patients in control and experimental groups were homogeneous in terms of their sociodemographic and clinical variables and QOL score. Yoga practices were effective in improving the QOL of breast cancer patients in the experimental group in the areas of global health status, physical function, role function, and emotional function and decreasing the symptoms of fatigue, insomnia, loss of appetite, and constipation, during the period of chemotherapy. Yoga practices comprising of relaxation techniques reduce many side effects and improve the QOL of women undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.|[{'npi': 'yoga', 'out': 'fatigue', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'yoga', 'out': 'physical functioning', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'yoga', 'out': 'emotional functioning', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'fatigue', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'physical functioning', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'emotional functioning', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}]

This study examined the impact of a randomly assigned KD on quality of life, physical activity and biomarkers in patients with breast cancer. A total of 80 patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and without a history of renal disease or diabetes were randomly assigned to either a KD or a control group for this 12-week trial. Concurrent with the first, third, and fifth chemotherapy sessions, quality of life, physical activity, and biomarkers (thyroid function tests, electrolytes, albumin, ammonia, ALP, lactate and serum ketones) were assessed. Dietary intake was also recorded on admission and the end of the treatment. No significant differences were seen in quality of life or physical activity scores between the two groups after 12 weeks; however, the KD group showed higher global quality of life and physical activity scores compared to the control group at 6 weeks (P = 0.02 P = 0.01). Also, serum lactate and ALP levels decreased significantly in the KD group compared to the control group at the end of the intervention (10.7 ± 3 vs 13.3 ± 4, 149 ± 71 vs 240 ± 164, P = 0.02 and P = 0.007, respectively). A significant inverse association was observed between total carbohydrate intake and serum beta-hydroxybutyrate at 12 weeks (r = - 0.77 P < 0.001). No significant differences between groups were observed in thyroid hormones, electrolytes, albumin, LDH or ammonia. Compliance among KD subjects ranged from 66.7 to 79.2% as assessed by dietary intake and serum ketones levels of > 0.5. According to our results, besides a higher global quality of life and physical activity scores compared to the control group at 6 weeks, KD diet combined to chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer does not bring additional benefit about quality of life and physical activity at 12 weeks. However, decreases seen in levels of lactate and ALP in the KD group suggest that a KD may benefit patients with breast cancer.

Fifty-nine older women were randomly assigned in three groups: non-exercise control (CON, n = 19), narrow-pyramid system (NPR, n = 20), and wide-pyramid system (WPR, n = 20). Training was performed for eight weeks (eight exercises for the whole-body, 3x/week) in which NPR and WPR performed three sets of 12/10/8 and 15/10/5 repetitions, respectively. Regional body fat was estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and blood parameters related to glycemic, lipid, and inflammatory profiles were assessed. After the training period, although no difference was observed for the magnitude of the changes between NPR and WPR, significant group by time interactions indicated benefits with RT compared to CON for reducing body fat (mainly android body fat; -7%) and improving glucose, HDL-C, LDL-C and C-reactive protein ( p < 0.05). Composite z-score of cardiovascular risk, created by the average of the intervention effects on the outcomes, indicate similar responses between NPR and WPR, differing from CON ( p < 0.001). Results indicate that both the repetition zones of the pyramidal RT reduced similarly the cardiovascular risk in older women.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cardiovascular risk', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'cardiovascular risk', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}]

Participants were randomly assigned to a control ( n = 8) or HIIT group ( n = 9). All participants performed a graded exercise test (GXT) on an electronically-braked cycle ergometer to determine maximal aerobic power (MAP, Watts). HIIT was performed three days per week for four weeks. Each HIIT session consisted of three to five cycling bouts of 30 s each at 80% MAP, followed by four-minutes of recovery at 40% MAP. Forty-eight hours after the last bout of exercise, both groups performed a follow-up GXT. Non-fasting blood samples were collected before and immediately after each GXT. Mixed factorial (2 groups x 4 measures, and 2 groups x 2 measures) ANOVA was used to assess BDNF concentrations, performance and anthropometric variables.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of 8 weeks of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) on the myocardial angiogenic factors and histological changes in male diabetic rats. Thirty-two male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into four groups: healthy non-exercised control, diabetic (D), D + HIIT, and D+ MICT groups. Diabetes type 2 was induced by a high-fat diet for 2 weeks and a single injection of streptozotocin. Following confirmation of diabetes, animals were subjected to HIIT (90 to 95% of VO2max) or MICT (50-65% of VO2max) protocols 5 days a week for 8 weeks. Western blotting was used for detection of protein expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP2) in the left ventricle. In addition, baseline and final blood glucose and body weight were measured. Histological changes were evaluated using H&E and Masson's trichrome staining. The results showed that exercise increased protein levels of pro-angiogenic factors while reduced anti-angiogenic factors protein levels in diabetic animals. These changes were followed by increased capillary density and reduced interstitial fibrosis in the left ventricle. Moreover, the MICT was superior to HIIT in enhancing angiogenic factors and attenuation of blood glucose and fibrosis in the diabetic rats. These findings confirm the effectiveness of exercise, particularly MICT, in the improvement of diabetic cardiomyopathy.|[{'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'blood glucose', 'dis': 'Diabetes', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'fibrosis', 'dis': 'Diabetes', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'angiogenesis', 'dis': 'Diabetes', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'blood glucose', 'dis': 'Diabetes', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'fibrosis', 'dis': 'Diabetes', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'angiogenesis', 'dis': 'Diabetes', 'eff': 3}]

Informal caregiver time was not different between the AEx and ST groups. Our analysis extends recent work by revealing specific benefits for instrumental activities of daily living for individuals in the early stages of AD and supports the value of exercise for individuals with cognitive impairment.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cognition', 'dis': 'Alzheimer Disease', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'memory', 'dis': 'Alzheimer Disease', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'cognition', 'dis': 'Alzheimer Disease', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'memory', 'dis': 'Alzheimer Disease', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'cognition', 'dis': 'Alzheimer Disease', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'memory', 'dis': 'Alzheimer Disease', 'eff': 3}]

With evidence suggesting that women with coronary artery disease are less likely to adhere to exercise during cardiac rehabilitation and are more likely to drop out, it is important to understand these factors in order to optimize cardiac rehabilitation programs for women. Methods: We contribute to the discussion by presenting findings from a qualitative study using two focus groups with nine women with coronary artery disease sharing their experiences with attending cardiac rehabilitation and exercising in this setting, in addition to their perceived motivators and barriers to performing aerobic interval training. Focus group transcripts were analysed using a deductive thematic approach with Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory as the guiding conceptual framework. Results: Four themes were identified regarding the attitudes and experiences of attending and exercising at cardiac rehabilitation, while five themes capturing the motivators and barriers for these women to perform aerobic interval training were identified for the first time. These novel themes encompassed the daunting nature of it, the physical discomfort associated with it, and conversely, the potential sense of enjoyment and accomplishment that it could bring. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the complexity of implementation of aerobic interval training into clinical practice, and suggests that further research is warranted to explore this domain.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONDespite challenges in feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial in female patients with coronary artery disease examining the effects of aerobic interval training versus moderate-intensity continuous exercise on aerobic exercise capacity, there was a significant per protocol treatment effect of 0.95 ml·kg -1 ·min -1 in favour of aerobic interval training.The cardiac rehabilitation environment provides key facilitators and perceived benefits for exercising and attending cardiac rehabilitation for women, and thus emphasises the need for improving referral and enrolment processes specifically for women into cardiac rehabilitation programs.Aerobic interval training may elicit feelings of fear and physical discomfort, or may be precluded by comorbid conditions, therefore, judicious consideration must be taken in examining the suitability of implementation into clinical practice for each female patient.|[{'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'cardiac rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Heart Diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Heart Diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cardiac rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Heart Diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Heart Diseases', 'eff': 3}]

Twenty-four healthy men aged 35-55 were randomized in a small-sided recreational volleyball group (RV = 12; age: 44.7 ± 6.34 years; body mass index: 25.85 ± 1.74) and control group (CON = 12; age: 42.9 ± 8.72 years; body mass index: 25.62 ± 1.48). The RV group carried out a volleyball training program, whereas the CON group continued their daily life activities during this period. The participants in the RV group performed 2/3 training sessions of 90 min per week. Results from a repeated measure ANOVA indicated a significant group × time interaction for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (F = 6.776, p = 0.016, partial ƞ 2 = 0.235) and for resting heart rate (F = 11.647, p = 0.002, partial ƞ 2 = 0.346) in favor of the RV group. No significant changes were observed for body weight, body mass index, and diastolic blood pressure. Results for physical fitness indicated a significant interaction for Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test-level 2 (F = 11.648, p = 0.003, partial ƞ 2 = 0.380), with no significant changes in both groups for handgrip strength. Recreational small-sided volleyball can be an effective training modality to stimulate a decrease in LDL cholesterol and resting HR with small improvements in cardiovascular fitness. Recreational volleyball played only two times per week shows positive cardiovascular fitness and health-related adaptations, which may contribute to the reduction of the risk of developing lifestyle diseases.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'blood pressure', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cardiovascular fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'heart rate', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'body mass index', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cholesterol', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'physical fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'blood pressure', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'cardiovascular fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'heart rate', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'body mass index', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'cholesterol', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'physical fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}]

However, women are less active than men, which contributes to low physical fitness and a high risk of CVD. Thus, the objective of this study is to analyze the effect of two exercise interventions on health-related physical fitness in sedentary employed females. Methods : A total of 98 physically inactive adult women were randomly assigned to 3 study groups: the control group (CG) = 31, the endurance training group based on Zumba Fitness ® classes (ET; n = 39), and the concurrent training group that had an extra muscle-strengthening workout after the Zumba Fitness ® class (CnT; n = 28). Body composition (BMI, waist circumference), motor fitness (one-leg stand test), musculoskeletal fitness (shoulder-neck mobility, handgrip strength test, jump and reach test, and dynamic sit-up test), and cardiorespiratory fitness (2-km test and estimated VO 2 max) were assessed with the ALPHA-Fit test battery for adults. Results : Both interventions showed a significant improvement in the majority of health-related fitness and body composition variables/test (waist circumference: ET = -2.275 ± 0.95, p = 0.02, CnT = -2.550 ± 1.13, p = 0.03; one-stand leg test: ET = 13.532 ± 2.65, p < 0.001; CnT = 11.656 ± 2.88, p < 0.001; shoulder-neck mobility: ET = 1.757 ± 0.44, p < 0.001, CnT = 2.123 ± 0.47, p < 0.001; handgrip test: 0.274 ± 0.08, p < 0.001, CnT = 0.352 ± 0.08, p < 0.001; dynamic sit-up: ET = 1.769 ± 0.45, p < 0.001, CnT = -1.836 ± 0.49, p < 0.001; 2-km test time: -1.280 ± 0.25, p < 0.001, CnT = -1.808 ± 0.28, p < 0.001; estimated VO 2 max: ET = 1.306 ± 0.13, p < 0.001, CnT = 1.191 ± 0.15, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences after the intervention between the two exercise intervention groups. Conclusions : Exercise interventions based on Zumba fitness ® or Zumba fitness ® combined with an extra muscle-strengthening workout based on bodyweight training exercises are effective strategies to improve the health-related physical fitness in sedentary women employees.|[{'npi': 'exercise interventions', 'out': 'physical fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'musculoskeletal fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'range of motion', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'endurance', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'grip strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'physical fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'endurance training', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'endurance training', 'out': 'musculoskeletal fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'endurance training', 'out': 'range of motion', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'endurance training', 'out': 'endurance', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'endurance training', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'endurance training', 'out': 'grip strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'endurance training', 'out': 'physical fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'exercise interventions', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'exercise interventions', 'out': 'musculoskeletal fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'exercise interventions', 'out': 'range of motion', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'exercise interventions', 'out': 'endurance', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'exercise interventions', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'exercise interventions', 'out': 'grip strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'alcoholic beverages', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'alcoholic beverages', 'out': 'musculoskeletal fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'alcoholic beverages', 'out': 'range of motion', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'alcoholic beverages', 'out': 'endurance', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'alcoholic beverages', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'alcoholic beverages', 'out': 'grip strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'alcoholic beverages', 'out': 'physical fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'diet', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'diet', 'out': 'range of motion', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'diet', 'out': 'endurance', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'diet', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'diet', 'out': 'grip strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'diet', 'out': 'physical fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'diet', 'out': 'musculoskeletal fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}]

A single-blinded randomised controlled trial. Thirty-one diabetic obese patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were recruited into this study. The patients were randomly classified into exercise and control groups, fifteen patients in the exercise group and sixteen patients in the control group. The exercise group received an 8-week moderate-intensity continuous aerobic exercise program with standard medical treatment, while the control group received standard medical treatment without any exercise program. Hepatic fat content and visceral lipids were assessed before and after intervention at the end of the study. Baseline and clinical characteristics showed a nonsignificant difference between the two groups ( p > 0.05). At the end of the intervention, the aerobic exercise showed significant improvements (serum triglycerides and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), p ≤ 0.002, total cholesterol, p =0.004, visceral fats, p =0.016, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), p =0.022, high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), p =0.038, alanine transaminases (AL), p =0.044, intrahepatic triglyceride and HOMA-IR, p =0.046, and body mass index (BMI), p =0.047), while the control group showed a nonsignificant difference ( p > 0.05). The postintervention analysis showed significant differences in favor of the aerobic exercise group ( p < 0.05). Moderate-intensity continuous aerobic exercise reduces the hepatic fat content and visceral lipids in hepatic patients with diabesity. Recommendations should be prescribed for encouraging moderate-intensity aerobic exercise training, particularly hepatic patients with diabesity.|[{'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'cholesterol', 'dis': 'Diabetes', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'cholesterol', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cholesterol', 'dis': 'Diabetes', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cholesterol', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}]

The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the mat Pilates method for improving symptoms in women with fibromyalgia. A single blind randomized controlled trial in which 42 women with fibromyalgia were randomized into two groups: mat Pilates and aquatic aerobic exercise. The exercises were performed twice a week for 12 weeks. Two evaluations were performed: one at baseline (T0), and another at 12 weeks after randomization (T12). The primary outcome was pain measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes were function (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]), quality of life (Short Form 36 [SF-36]), fear avoidance (Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire [FABQ-BR]) and pain catastrophizing (Pain-Related Catastrophizing Thoughts Scale [PRCTS]).

Lidocaine iontophoresis is effective for reducing muscle spasticity in adults. To investigate the effect of lidocaine epinephrine iontophoresis combined with exercises on gait and spasticity in children with spastic hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP). Thirty children with spastic HCP aged 4-6 (5.20±0.32) years were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n = 15) and control group (n = 15). Children in both groups received one hour of exercises, three times a week for three months. Children in the experimental group received 2% lidocaine iontophoresis immediately before the exercises. The lidocaine iontophoresis was delivered for 20 minutes (1mA/min). Spatio-temporal gait parameters were assessed within one week before and after the intervention using 3D motion analysis. Surface electromyography was used to assess muscle tone using H/M ratio of the soleus muscle. ANOVA was used to investigate the differences between experimental and control groups. Statistical significance was set at P value less than 0.05. There was no difference between groups at baseline.

A single-blinded, six-week, randomized controlled pilot trial involving 70 sedentary young Chinese females, aged 18-30 years, was conducted. An intervention group (IG) ( n = 33) underwent a HIIT intervention and health education, while a waitlist group (WG) ( n = 37) only received health education. In pre-, mid-, and post-tests, both groups filled out questionnaires about physical activity, sedentary behavior, and mental health. Cognitive functions were assessed at the pre- and post-tests by computer-administered cognitive tests. A mixed-effect model with repeated measures was used to analyze outcomes of interest. The retention rate of the IG and WG was 100% and 78.38%, respectively. The IG were found to have significantly increased rates of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (M diff = 940.61, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 576.67, 1304.55) from pre-test to post-test, while the WG demonstrated a more marked reduction in sedentary time (M diff = -73.02, p = 0.038, 95% CI: -141.90, -4.14) compared with the IG in the post-test. Moreover, anxiety and stress levels were shown to significantly reduce in the IG over the six-week period (M diff = -4.73, p = 0.002, 95% CI: -7.30, -2.15 and M diff = -5.09, p = 0.001, 95% CI: -8.29, -1.89, respectively). In addition, we observed a significant improvement in verbal ability ( p = 0.008, ηp2 = 0.19) following the HIIT intervention and effects of the interaction with time on processing speed ( p = 0.050, ηp2 = 0.10) and episodic memory ( p = 0.048, ηp2 = 0.11). Moreover, the IG had better global cognitive performance than the WG in the post-test (M diff = 8.28, p = 0.003, 95% CI: 3.06, 13.50). In summary, both an online bodyweight HIIT intervention combined with health education, or health education alone, can effectively improve health-related behaviors, but the behavioral consequences may differ based on the emphasis of different intervention modalities. Furthermore, the ""bodyweight HIIT plus health education"" modality might be a more promising online intervention strategy to mitigate against negative emotions and improve cognitive function."|[{'npi': 'health education', 'out': 'anxiety', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'health education', 'out': 'psychological health', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'health education', 'out': 'speed', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'health education', 'out': 'cognitive function', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'health education', 'out': 'cognition', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'health education', 'out': 'cognitive performance', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'health education', 'out': 'memory', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'anxiety', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'stress', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'psychological health', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'speed', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'cognitive function', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'cognition', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'cognitive performance', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'memory', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'anxiety', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'psychological health', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'speed', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cognitive function', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cognition', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cognitive performance', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'memory', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}]

The first evaluation was performed at the end of the PAP (T0 + 6 mo). At T0 + 6 mo, both groups received the six-month PAP with a second evaluation at T0 + 12 mo. The primary outcome was the evolution of exercise capacity measured using the six-minute walk test (6 MWT) at T0 + 6 mo. Secondary outcomes included PAP safety and changes in other physical functions, self-esteem, and quality-of-life parameters. The trial involved 80 children and adolescents (age range 5.0-18.4 years), of whom 41 were assigned to the interventional group and 39 to the control group. Underlying malignancies were leukemia (39%) and a broad range of solid tumors (61%). No adverse events occurred. At T0 + 6 mo, the evolution of the 6 MWT distance (±SEM) was improved in the intervention group vs. the control group (86 ± 12 m vs. 32 ± 6 m, p < 0.001). Several other physical parameters were significantly improved in the intervention group. Global self-esteem and parent-reported quality-of-life were significantly increased in the intervention group. Analysis at T0 + 12 mo showed persistence of the benefits in the intervention group on exercise capacity evolution (115 ± 18 m vs. 49 ± 11 m, p = 0.004) and on most physical and QoL parameters.

This randomised cross-over study compared the acute gluco-regulatory and the physiological responses of high-intensity interval exercise and resistance exercise. Sixteen (eight males and eight females) recreationally active individuals, aged (mean ± SD) 22 ± 7 years, participated with a seven-day period between interventions. The high-intensity interval exercise trial consisted of twelve, 30 s cycling intervals at 80% of peak power capacity and 90 s active recovery. The resistance exercise trial consisted of four sets of 10 repetitions for three lower-limb exercises at 80% 1-RM, matched for duration of high-intensity interval exercise. Exercise was performed after an overnight fast, with blood samples collected every 30 min, for two hours after exercise. There was a significant interaction between time and intervention for glucose ( p = 0.02), which was, on average (mean ± SD), 0.7 ± 0.7 mmol∙L -1 higher following high-intensity interval exercise, as compared to resistance exercise. Cortisol concentration over time was affected by intervention ( p = 0.03), with cortisol 70 ± 103 ng∙mL -1 higher ( p = 0.015), on average, following high-intensity interval exercise.

This study assessed whether a short course of exercise training post-AECOPD with periodic reinforcement exercise training and phone call reminders reduces readmissions and increases physical activity in COPD patients. Subjects were randomized into either the (i) intervention group (IG), consisting of 4-8 weeks of training supervised by a physiotherapist and phone contact every 2 weeks by a case manager providing support and reinforcement of continuous exercise at home or (ii) usual care group (UG), which had no input by a physiotherapist or case manager. Readmissions were assessed at 12 months. Activities of all patients were assessed by an activity monitor at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Altogether, 136 subjects were included and randomized (68 in IG and 68 in UG). The age, gender and FEV 1 % predicted were 75.0 ± 6.7 years, 132 males and 47.0 ± 16.2%, respectively. The mean number of readmissions for AECOPD (1.06 vs 1.72 times, P = 0.014) was less and time to first readmission was increased (146.8 vs 122.4 days, P = 0.005) in the IG versus UG at 12 months. At 12 months, there was no change in activity measured by activity monitor between the two groups. This programme decreased exacerbation frequency and increased the time of readmissions for AECOPD. It did not improve physical activities and exercise tolerance at 12 months.|[{'npi': 'pulmonary rehabilitation', 'out': 'exercise tolerance', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'pulmonary rehabilitation', 'out': 'rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physiotherapy', 'out': 'exercise tolerance', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physiotherapy', 'out': 'rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}]

Does a behavior change intervention aimed at increasing physical activity change asthma clinical control, physical activity, sedentary time, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and anxiety and depression symptoms? This single-blind, randomized controlled trial included participants who were allocated to an intervention group (IG) or to a control group (CG). Both groups received usual care and disease-specific education. Participants in the IG also underwent an 8-week behavior change intervention aimed at increasing physical activity. Prior to and following the intervention period, measures were made of asthma clinical control (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ]), physical activity, sedentary time and sleep quality (ActiGraph), HRQoL (Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire), and anxiety and depression symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Data on asthma exacerbations were recorded 12 months prior to and throughout the intervention period. Fifty-one participants were included (CG, n = 26; IG, n = 25). On completion of the intervention period, compared with the CG, those in the IG exhibited improvements in asthma control (mean difference [95% CI] in ACQ score, -0.8 [-1.1 to -0.4]); in daily step count, 3,605 [1,937 to 8,867] steps/d; in sleep efficiency, 9.2% [-7.1% to 21.9%]; and a reduction in sedentary time, -1.1 [-2.9 to -0.6] h/d). No between-group difference in HRQoL was observed. The percentage of participants who experienced exacerbations during the intervention period was 27% in the IG vs 60% in the CG (P = .04). The change in time spent in moderate-intensity physical activity was inversely associated with change in ACQ (r = -0.60). Compared with the CG, a higher percentage of participants in the IG reported a reduction in anxiety symptoms (43% vs 0%; P < .02).

Eighty-five patients with non-specific CLBP were separated into two groups (Intervention group: completed a progressive strength training program 3 days per week for 8 weeks; Control group: received the usual care). The intervention group showed a recurrence rate of 8.3%, while the control group had a recurrence rate of 33.3% and a shorter time until the first recurrent episode. The intervention group showed increased lumbar extensor strength, left-hand handgrip strength, and reduced the number of pain sites compared with the control group. Results also showed greater odds for reducing LBP intensity and disability in the intervention group.

The aim of this study was, thus, to examine the effect of a single bout of such an exercise mode on behavioral and cognitive electrophysiological performance involving cognitive interference inhibition in obese women. After the estimated VO 2 max and percentage fat (measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic, Bedford, MA, USA) were assessed, 32 sedentary obese female adults were randomly assigned to an exercise group (EG) and a control group (CG), with their behavioral performance being recorded with concomitant electrophysiological signals when performing a Stroop task. Then, the EG engaged in 30 min of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise combined with resistance exercise, and the CG rested for a similar duration of time without engaging in any type of exercise. After the interventions, the neurocognitive performance was measured again in the two groups. The results revealed that although acute exercise did not enhance the behavioral indices (e.g., accuracy rates (ARs) and reaction times (RTs)), cognitive electrophysiological signals were improved (e.g., shorter N2 and P3 latencies, smaller N2 amplitudes, and greater P3 amplitudes) in the Stroop task after the exercise intervention in the EG. The findings indicated that a combination of acute moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance exercise may improve the neurophysiological inhibitory control performance of obese women.|[{'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'cognitive performance', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'cognitive performance', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cognitive performance', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}]

Conventional cardiovascular rehabilitation (CCVR) programs have significant advantages, but non-conventional activities such as Nordic walking (NW) may offer additional health benefits. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of NW on cardiovascular performance and quality of life in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) compared to a CCVR program. This was a pseudo-randomized, prospective, single-blinded, parallel-group trial. The study was conducted at a resort/spa type facility located in a mountainous natural environment, 650 meters above sea level. Eighty-three CAD patients were allocated to either a Nordic walking or a control group. The NW group (N.=53; age 59.1±7.0 years) underwent a three-week outdoor exercise program consisting of 40 minutes of walking four-times per week, whereas the controls performed traditional walking instead of NW. A patient's prescribed exercise intensity was according to exertion tolerance within 50-70% of peak oxygen consumption (VO<inf>2max</inf>); rating of perceived exertion 'mild/moderate' (12 to 14 points) on the 0-20 Borg Scale. Primary endpoint: cardiovascular and functional performance (exercise ergometry [EE], metabolic equivalent of tasks [METs], ejection fraction [EF], Six-Minute Walking Test [6MWT]). Secondary endpoint was quality of life (Short-Form 36 Health Survey). Statistical analysis was performed by generalized estimating equations with Cohen's d effect size (ES). NW led to higher cardiovascular performance compared to CCVR (ΔEE: +11.0% vs. +3.2%, small ES; ΔMETs: +9.8% vs. +1.5%, medium ES) and better functional performance (Δ6MWT: +8.3% vs. +5.1%, small ES). No significant differences were detected in EF (P=0.240) and SF-36 (PCS, P=0.425; MCS, P=0.400). A three-week NW training program had clinically important effects, above and beyond CCVR, on cardiovascular and functional performance in CAD patients. Nordic walking is an accessible, safe, and effective low-threshold cardiac rehabilitation exercise training modality that seems to be particularly well-suited for people with limited functional and motivational capacities.|[{'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'cardiac rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Heart Diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Heart Diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'nordic walking', 'out': 'cardiac rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Heart Diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'nordic walking', 'out': 'rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Heart Diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cardiac rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Heart Diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Heart Diseases', 'eff': 3}]

To date, studies evaluating the impact of aerobic training in patients with LVADs have focused on moderate-intensity exercise. This pilot randomized controlled trial compared the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with those of moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on peak oxygen consumption (V̇O 2 peak) in patients with LVADs. Secondary outcomes included 6-minute walk test distance, flow-mediated dilation, and anthropometry. Assessments were conducted at baseline and after 12 weeks of supervised training performed 3 times weekly. Participants were randomized to HIIT (4 sets of 4 minutes at 80%-90% V̇O 2 reserve, alternating with 3 minutes at 50%-60% V̇O 2 reserve) or MICT groups (28 minutes continuously at 50%-60% V̇O 2 reserve). Within and between-group differences were analyzed using linear mixed models. Data are expressed as marginal means with 95% confidence intervals or as mean ± SD. A total of 21 participants were randomized (HIIT: age 57.7 ± 13.1 years; n=11 and MICT: age 55.6 ± 14.2 years; n=10) (mean ± SD). No major adverse events occurred in response to training in either group. HIIT significantly improved V̇O 2 peak (15.6 [13.2-17.8] to 18.4 [16.0-20.8] ml/kg/min) (marginal mean [95% CI]) compared with MICT (16.2 [13.8-18.7] to 17.2 [14.6-19.7] ml/kg/min; p < 0.05 between groups). No significant group differences were detected in secondary outcomes. In patients with LVADs, HIIT was well tolerated and increased aerobic capacity more than MICT. These preliminary findings support the prescription of high-intensity exercise in clinically stable patients with LVADs but warrant validation in a larger sample and across a broader range of physiologic and clinical outcomes.

Materials and Methods:             We conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial. Thirty-eight voluntary participants were divided into two groups<u>:</u> cancer group ( n = 19; age = 61.46 ± 8.79 years; body mass index [BMI] = 28.36 ± 4.94 kg/m 3 ) and control group ( n = 19; age = 57.62 ± 7.57 years; BMI = 28.06 ± 3.74 kg/m 3 ), and they participated in the study. All participants performed an exergame protocol by using Xbox 360 Kinect ® (Microsoft, Redmond) with the game Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012 two to three times per week for 20 sessions. They were evaluated through the isometric dynamometer in the middle deltoid muscle and the SPADI at three moments: preintervention (EV1), after 10 sessions (EV2), and after 20 sessions (EV3).               Results:             The cancer group scored higher on both the disability index, in all three evaluations, and the pain index, in EV2 and EV3, when compared with the control group. There was a significant reduction in the disability score in EV2 and EV3 when compared with EV1 in the cancer group, whereas pain was lower in EV2 and EV3 when compared with EV1 in the control group. There were no significant interevaluation or intergroup differences in the maximal isometric voluntary contraction of the deltoid muscle of both upper limbs.               Conclusion:             At the end of the exergaming, protocol reduced the disability of the shoulder joint of the cancer group and decreased the differences between the groups for disability and pain scores, without changing isometric force.|[{'npi': 'exergaming', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}]

We examine the relationship between PA and the development of CVD events, CVD death and all-cause mortality among KTRs. A total of 3050 KTRs enrolled in an international homocysteine-lowering randomized controlled trial were examined (38% female; mean age 51.8 ± 9.4 years; 75% white; 20% with prevalent CVD). PA was measured at baseline using a modified Yale Physical Activity Survey, divided into tertiles (T1, T2 and T3) from lowest to highest PA. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to graph the risk of events; Cox proportional hazards regression models examined the association of baseline PA levels with CVD events (e.g. stroke, myocardial infarction), CVD mortality and all-cause mortality over time. Participants were followed up to 2500 days (mean 3.7 ± 1.6 years). The cohort experienced 426 CVD events and 357 deaths. Fully adjusted models revealed that, compared to the lowest tertile of PA, the highest tertile experienced a significantly lower risk of CVD events {hazard ratio [HR] 0.76 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59-0.98]}, CVD mortality [HR 0.58 (95% CI 0.35-0.96)] and all-cause mortality [HR 0.76 (95% CI 0.59-0.98)]. Results were similar in unadjusted models. PA was associated with a reduced risk of CVD events and all-cause mortality among KTRs. These observed associations in a large, international sample, even when controlling for traditional CVD risk factors, indicate the potential importance of PA in reducing CVD and death among KTRs.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'mortality', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'mortality', 'dis': 'Stroke', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'all-cause mortality', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'all-cause mortality', 'dis': 'Stroke', 'eff': 3}]

A randomized controlled trial was conducted between August 2014 and April 2015 in Japan. Elementary school children aged 6 to 12 years with a percentage overweight (%OW) of ≥20% were recruited. One hundred and ninety children wanted to participate in the program, and all were accepted. After viewing a video that promoted physical activity through walking, participants were randomly assigned to three groups: walking (≥10 000 steps on school holidays), limiting screen time (<90 min on weekdays and <150 min on school holidays), and a control group (no intervention). The primary outcome was a decrease in %OW after 3 months' intervention. Per protocol analysis was performed using 156 participants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria of a %OW ≥20%. The mean %OW was 35 ± 7% before intervention. The mean reduction in %OW after intervention in the walking (n = 59), limiting ST (n = 46), and control (n = 51) groups were -4.06 ± 4.84, -1.97 ± 4.62, and -1.81 ± 3.64 percentage points, respectively. Reduction in %OW was significantly larger in the walking group than in the control group: adjusted mean difference, -2.18 percentage points (95% confidence interval, -3.85 to -0.52), P = 0.002. The intervention in children also had favorable effects on the lifestyles of their parents. The intention-to-treat analysis of all 190 participants showed comparable results. Promoting physical activity through walking on school holidays may be an additional strategy for treating elementary school children with obesity.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}]

Lifestyle modification in order to increase exercise capacity is key in the prevention and rehabilitation of chronic diseases. This could be achieved by active commute. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of daily active commuting on physical activity (PA) and exercise capacity. Seventy-three healthy hospital employees (age: 46 ± 9 years, 38% male), with a predominantly passive way of commuting, were randomly assigned to two parallel groups, a control group (CG, N = 22) or an intervention group (IG, N = 51), which was further split into public transportation/active commuting (IG-PT, N = 25) and cycling (IG-C, N = 26). Both intervention groups were asked to reach 150 min/wk of moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise during their commute for 1 year. CG maintained a passive commuting mode. All participants underwent assessment of anthropometry, risk factor stratification, and exercise capacity by a medical doctor at the Institute of Sports Medicine, Prevention and Rehabilitation. Weekly physical activity, using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and commuting behavior, using an online diary, were used to assess physical activity. At the end of the study, the change in exercise capacity did significantly differ between IG and CG (P = .003, ES = 0.82). Actively covered distances through commuting significantly differed between groups (walking P = .026; cycling P < .001). Therefore, active commuting improves exercise capacity and can be recommended to the working population to increase exercise capacity.|[{'npi': 'bicycling', 'out': 'exercise capacity', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'exercise capacity', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'exercise capacity', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'sports', 'out': 'exercise capacity', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}]

While physical activity and exercise therapy are not typically part of the standard treatment for this syndrome, there is mounting evidence that regular participation in activities involving physical exertion has a positive impact on psychological functioning in people with FM. This study compares the impact of two different interventions, aerobic exercise training and Zumba dancing, on working memory, motor function and depressive symptoms among female patients with FM. The design also included a control condition. A total of sixty middle-aged female patients with FM (mean age: 35.76 years) and undergoing standard care took part in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the following three conditions: aerobic exercise training, Zumba dancing, or control. At baseline and 12 weeks later after the end of the intervention, participants' working memory, motor function and depressive symptom severity were assessed. Working memory, motor function and depressive symptoms improved over time, but only in the aerobic exercise training and Zumba dancing conditions than in the control condition. Post-hoc analyses showed that improvements were greatest among participants assigned to Zumba dancing, followed by participants who engaged in aerobic exercise training; the scores of the control group remained virtually unchanged. Aerobic exercise training and Zumba dancing can be recommended as add-ons to standard care to improve working memory and to reduce severity of depressive symptoms among female patients with FM. Although motor function improved in both intervention groups, the effects did not reach clinical relevance.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'depression', 'dis': 'Fibromyalgia', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cognitive function', 'dis': 'Fibromyalgia', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'memory', 'dis': 'Fibromyalgia', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'working memory', 'dis': 'Fibromyalgia', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'depression', 'dis': 'Fibromyalgia', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'cognitive function', 'dis': 'Fibromyalgia', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'memory', 'dis': 'Fibromyalgia', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'working memory', 'dis': 'Fibromyalgia', 'eff': 3}]

A low-cost and safe approach is greatly required to reduce these disabilities and the effects of aerobic exercise have generated varied evidence to date. The aim of the study was to explore the effects of 6 weeks of intermittent aerobic exercise (IAE) on aerobic capacity, muscle fatigability, and quality of life (QoL) in diabetic burned patients (DBPs). The study design was a prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Between March 2018 and July 2019 thirty-six (22 males and 16 females) diabetic burned patients were included in the study, their age ranged 35-55 years. They were clinically diagnosed with type 2 DM and total body surface area (TBSA) was 15-30%. The participants were randomly assigned to the IAE group (n = 18) and controls (n = 18). Aerobic capacity, muscle fatigability, and QoL were assessed initially and repeated after 6 weeks of intervention. Initial data demonstrated non-significant differences between the IAE and control groups (p > 0.05). Comparing pre- and post-intervention outcomes showed significant improvement of VO 2 max, muscle fatigability, QoL domains in the IAE group after 6 weeks intervention (p < 0.05) and non-significant changes in the control group (p > 0.05). The IAE group showed statistically significant improvement more than the control group in all outcome measures (p < 0.05). 6 weeks of intermittent aerobic exercise is an effective alternative modality to improve aerobic capacity, muscle fatigability, and QoL in DBPs. Adherence to intermittent aerobic exercise should be practicable into mainstream clinical intervention for those patients.|[{'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'aerobic capacity', 'dis': 'Diabetes', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'aerobic capacity', 'dis': 'Diabetes', 'eff': 3}]

Before and after 16 weeks of intervention (CAT or IAT) or observation (CG), hormonal and metabolic parameters, body composition and anthropometric indices were evaluated. Aerobic physical training on a treadmill consisted of 30- to 50-minute sessions with intensities ranging from 60% to 90% of the maximum heart rate. In the CA group, there was reduction in waist circumference (WC) (P = .045), hip circumference (P = .032), cholesterol (P ≤ .001), low-density lipoprotein (P = .030) and testosterone (P ≤ .001). In the IAT group, there was a reduction in WC (P = .014), waist-to-hip ratio (P = .012), testosterone (P = .019) and the free androgen index (FAI) (P = .037). The CG showed increases in WC (P = .049), total body mass (P = .015), body fat percentage (P = .034), total mass of the arms (P ≤ .001), trunk fat percentage (P = .033), leg fat percentage (P = .021) and total gynoid mass (P = .011). CAT and IAT training reduced anthropometric indices and hyperandrogenism in PCOS, whereas only IAT training reduced the FAI.

However, it is unclear what conditions promote FGF21 and KLB expression in different tissues. Therefore, we studied expression of FGF21 and KLB with respect to two exercise regimes: moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) (two popular strategies in weight loss). Mice were randomly divided into three groups (n = 8 per group): MICT, HIIT, and sedentary lifestyle (SED). All mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks to induce obesity. The exercise was performed on a motorized treadmill for another eight weeks and the diet continued in each group. We found that both MICT and HIIT had positive effects on the loss of HFD-induced body weight increase and serum FGF21 levels. HIIT promoted decrease of the body weight and serum triglyceride (TG) levels, while MICT was more effective at enhancing FGF21 and KLB expression in the liver, brown adipose tissue (BAT), and muscle at the mRNA and protein levels.|[{'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'weight loss', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight loss', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}]

We assessed the effects of joint mobilization and active stretching on ankle joint range of motion and gait in stroke patients. In total, 45 stroke patients were evenly divided into three groups: joint mobilization, active stretching, and combination (joint mobilization and active stretching) groups. Patients in each group received the corresponding interventions in a non-simultaneous manner for 6 weeks in total (3 days per week, 15 min per day). The range of motion of the ankle joint was measured using a goniometer, and spatiotemporal gait variables were measured using G-walk. All measurements were taken immediately before and after the 6-week intervention. The joint mobilization group exhibited significantly increased range of motion for ankle joint after the intervention (p < 0.05), while the spatiotemporal gait variables were unchanged. In the active stretching group, both the range of motion of the ankle joint in the supine position and the spatiotemporal gait variables (cadence, speed, stride length) were significantly increased (p < 0.05). In the combination group, both the range of motion of the ankle joint and spatiotemporal gait variables (cadence, speed, stride length) were significantly increased (p < 0.05). Combination therapy of joint mobilization and active stretching improves the range of motion of the ankle joint and spatiotemporal gait variables in stroke patients, suggesting that ankle rehabilitation of stroke patients should include limited joint structure and muscles shortness.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'speed', 'dis': 'Stroke', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Stroke', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'range of motion', 'dis': 'Stroke', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'speed', 'dis': 'Stroke', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Stroke', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'range of motion', 'dis': 'Stroke', 'eff': 3}]

Twenty-one physically inactive subjects were randomized into two groups: the exercise group (EG) or the control group (CG). EG performed 12 weeks of combined physical training. CG was advised to maintain usual daily activities. EG received a structured, individually supervised exercise program with two 60-minute sessions per week. Each session included warmup (5-minutes), aerobic (15-20 minutes at 14-17 on Borg scale), strength (2-3 sets, 10-15 repetitions), and 5-minute active stretches. Sociodemographic characteristics, clinical information, memory (Digit Span Test [DST]), executive function (Trail Making Test [TMT] A and B), Stroop Color and Word Test, a verbal fluency task, global cognitive function (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]), anthropometric measurements (weight, height, and hip and waist circumferences), cardiorespiratory fitness (maximal oxygen consumption [VO 2 max]), and strength (dynamometer) were measured at baseline and after the 12-week intervention. Exercise decreased time spent on TMT-A from baseline to postintervention (difference = -7.9 seconds, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -14.5 to -1.3, P = .023). EG improved total number of words on the verbal fluency task after intervention (difference = 8.1 words, 95% CI = 3.0 to 13.2, P = .002). EG also improved the score on MoCA at 1.7 (95% CI = 0.1 to 3.3, P = .043) points. We observed a 22.4% (95% CI = 13.1 to 31.6, P = .021) improvement in executive function in EG.

In animal study, 16 Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats with obesity were randomly divided into 2 groups: sedentary control (OLETF-CON) and 8-week aerobic treadmill training (OLETF-EX) groups. In human study, 15 subjects with obesity completed 8-week aerobic exercise training for 45 min at 60%-70% peak oxygen uptake intensity for 3 days/week. As a result of animal study, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) was decreased, and arterial phosphorylation levels of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), protein kinase B (Akt), and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), circulating levels of nitrite/nitrate (NOx) and irisin, and muscle messenger RNA expression of fibronectin type III domain containing 5 ( Fndc5 ) were increased in the OLETF-EX group compared with OLETF-CON group. In a human study, regular aerobic exercise reduced cfPWV and elevated circulating levels of NOx and irisin. Furthermore, change in circulating irisin levels by regular exercise was positively correlated with circulating NOx levels and was negatively correlated with cfPWV. Thus, aerobic exercise training-induced increase in irisin secretion may be related to reduction of arterial stiffness achieved by NO production via activated arterial AMPK-Akt-eNOS signaling pathway in obesity. Novelty Aerobic exercise training promoted irisin secretion with upregulation of muscle Fndc5 gene expression in rats with obesity. Irisin affected the activation of arterial AMPK-Akt-eNOS signaling by aerobic exercise training. Increased serum irisin level by aerobic exercise training was associated with reduction of arterial stiffness in obese adults.|[{'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'vascular stiffness', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'vascular stiffness', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}]

Healthy, black South African women with obesity (mean age 23 ± 3.5 years) and of isiXhosa ancestry were randomised into a 12-week aerobic and resistance exercise training group (n = 23) and a no exercise group (control, n = 22). Pre and post-intervention testing included assessment of SI, insulin response to glucose (AIRg), insulin secretion rate (ISR), hepatic insulin extraction (FEL) and disposition index (DI) (AIRg × SI) (frequently sampled i.v. glucose tolerance test); fat mass and regional adiposity (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry); hepatic, pancreatic and skeletal muscle fat content and abdominal s.c. and visceral adipose tissue volumes (MRI). Exercise training increased VO2peak (mean ± s.d.: 24.9 ± 2.42 to 27.6 ± 3.39 mL/kg/min, P < 0.001), SI (2.0 (1.2-2.8) to 2.2 (1.5-3.7) (mU/l)-1 min-1, P = 0.005) and DI (median (interquartile range): 6.1 (3.6-7.1) to 6.5 (5.6-9.2) × 103 arbitrary units, P = 0.028), and decreased gynoid fat mass (18.5 ± 1.7 to 18.2 ± 1.6%, P < 0.001) and body weight (84.1 ± 8.7 to 83.3 ± .9.7 kg, P = 0.038). None of these changes were observed in the control group, but body weight increased (P = 0.030). AIRg, ISR and FEL, VAT, SAT and ectopic fat were unaltered after exercise training. The increase in SI and DI were not associated with changes in regional or ectopic fat. Exercise training increased SI independent from changes in hyperinsulinemia and ectopic fat, suggesting that ectopic fat might not be a principal determinant of insulin resistance in this cohort.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'glucose tolerance', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'fat mass', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'glucose tolerance', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'fat mass', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'glucose tolerance', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'fat mass', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}]

The eligible participants, aged 65 to 80 years, were selected by a physician. Accordingly, a total number of 63 women with OSO syndrome were recruited and assessed using a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) instrument, body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m 2 , -2.5 ≤ T-score ≤ -1.0 of L1-L4, and/or total femur or femoral neck, and gait speed (10-meter walk test (10MWT)) ≤ 1 (m/s 2 ). The 12-week supervised EBRT was designed to train all major muscle groups for 3 times per week. In the first two sessions, the participants became familiar with targeted number of repetitions (TNRs) and OMNI-resistance exercise scale (OMNI-RES) to control exercise intensity. Following an adaptation phase of 4 weeks (1 set of 12 rep) using low resistance (yellow Thera-Band), exercise intensity progressively increased by adapting the resistance of the elastic band (based on the Thera-Band® force-elongation table) from yellow to red and further to black. The participants in the control group also received telephone contacts or face-to-face interviews on a weekly basis to maintain their typical diet and activity habits. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA was employed to determine the main changes (2 times×2 groups) after 12 weeks of training. Partial eta-squared (ηp 2 ) was additionally used to determine ES in ANOVA tests. At all the stages of data analysis in this RCT, intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed. The results of two-way ANOVA showed significant elevations in E2 (F = 7.881, p = 0.006, ES = 0.079), MQ (F = 4.225, p = 0.043, ES = 0.044), OSO Z-score (F = 7.091, p = 0.030, ES = 0.069), 30-s chair stand test (F = 4.599, p = 0.036, ES = 0.063) and hand grip strength (F = 6.411, p = 0.013, ES = 0.065) in the experimental group compared with those in the controls. Besides, there were no significant differences in CAF (F = 0.456, p = 0.501, ES = 0.005), CTX-I (F = 3.427, p = 0.067, ES = 0.036), adiponectin (F = 2.733, p = 0.102, ES = 0.029), sTnT (F = 3.245, p = 0.075, ES = 0.034), sclerostin (F = 2.927, p = 0.091, ES = 0.034), gait speed (10MWT) (F = 1.524, p = 0.220, ES = 0.016), 6MWT (F = 1.169, p = 0.284, ES = 0.017) and TUG (F = 1.502, p = 0.225, ES = 0.022), BMI (F = 0.354, p = 0.553, ES = 0.004), BFP (F = 2.888, p = 0.093, ES = 0.030), body mass content (BMC) (F = 0.030, p = 0.862, ES = 0.001) and BMD (F = 0.335, p = 0.564, ES = 0.004) between study groups. Taken together, the results of this study illustrated significant differences only in some OSO markers between groups after 48 h of chronic EBRT in women affected with OSO syndrome. Further research is thus recommended to design machine-based and elastic band-based training regimes at different intensities and volumes.|[{'npi': 'diet', 'out': 'body mass index', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 1}]
31478436|10.1080/17461391.2019.1663270|high-intensity interval neuromuscular training promotes exercise behavioral regulation, adherence and weight loss in inactive obese women|European journal of sport science|2020-07-01|['Overweight']|['Undefined']|['weight', 'weight loss', 'stress', 'psychological distress', 'well-being', 'adherence']|It is unclear how high-intensity, interval-type nontraditional exercise training programmes can be feasible and effective options for inactive obese individuals. This randomized controlled trial investigated the hypothesis that a 10-month high-intensity, interval-type neuromuscular training programme (DoIT) with adjunct portable modalities, performed in a small-group setting, induces improvements in psychological well-being, subjective vitality and exercise behavioural regulations in obese women. Associations between adherence, psychological and physiological indicators were also investigated. Forty-nine previously inactive obese females (36.4 ± 4.4 yrs) were randomly assigned to three groups (control; N = 21, 10-month training; N = 14, or 5-month training plus 5 month-detraining; N = 14). DoIT was a supervised, progressive, and time-efficient (<30 min) programme that used 10-12 functional/neuromotor exercises and prescribed work and rest time intervals (20-40 sec) in a circuit fashion (1-3 rounds) for 10 months. Questionnaires were used to measure psychological distress, subjective vitality, and behavioural regulations in exercise at pre-, mid-, and post-intervention. The 10-month training reduced psychological distress (72%, p = 0.001), external regulation (75%, p = 0.011) and increased vitality (53%, p = 0.001), introjected regulation (63%, p = 0.001), intrinsic regulation (33%, p = 0.004), and identified regulation (88%, p = 0.001). A moderate to strong positive relationship was found between adherence rate and identified regulation scores ( r = 0.59, p = 0.001) and between VO 2 peak and identified regulation scores ( r = 0.59, p = 0.001). A mild dissociation between exercise intensity and perceived exertion was also observed. Our novel findings suggest that a 10-month implementation of a high-intensity interval neuromuscular training programme promotes positive psychological adaptations provoking exercise behavioural regulation and adherence while inducing weight loss in inactive obese women.|[{'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'weight loss', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'psychological distress', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'adherence', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 2}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight loss', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'psychological distress', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'adherence', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}]

Forty-two participants with CAD were randomized to three sessions/week of either 4 × 4-minute high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or 40 minutes of usual care moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) for a 4-week supervised cardiac rehabilitation program, followed by three home-based sessions/week for 11 months. Liver fat (as intrahepatic lipid) and VAT were measured via magnetic resonance techniques. Data are mean change (95% CI). HIIT and MICT significantly reduced VAT over 3 months (-350 [-548 to -153] cm 3 vs. -456 [-634 to -278] cm 3 ; time × group effect: P = 0.421), with further improvement over 12 months (-545 [-818 to -271] cm 3 vs. -521 [-784 to -258] cm 3 ; time × group effect: P = 0.577) and no differences between groups. Both groups improved liver fat over 3 months, with HIIT tending to show greater reduction than MICT (-2.8% [-4.0% to -1.6%] vs. -1.4% [-2.4% to -0.4%]; time × group effect: P = 0.077). After 12 months, improvements were maintained to a similar degree. Higher exercise intensity predicted liver fat reduction (β = -0.3 [-0.7 to 0.0]; P = 0.042). HIIT and MICT reduced VAT over 3 and 12 months. For liver fat, HIIT tended to provide a slightly greater reduction compared with MICT. These findings support HIIT as a beneficial adjunct or alternative to MICT for reducing visceral and liver fat in patients with CAD.|[{'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'visceral fat', 'dis': 'Heart Diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'visceral fat', 'dis': 'Heart Diseases', 'eff': 3}]

Patients with obesity (body mass index (BMI)≥30 kg·m -2 ) and suboptimal controlled asthma (Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)≥0.75) were randomly assigned to a 3-month pulmonary rehabilitation programme (PR only), pulmonary rehabilitation programme with the use of an internet based self-management support programme (PR+SMS) or usual care. The pulmonary rehabilitation programme included high-intensity interval training, nutritional intervention and psychological group sessions. Patients in the usual care group were advised to lose weight and to exercise. The primary outcome was the difference of change of ACQ between PR only and PR+SMS after 3 months. Total follow-up was 12 months. 34 patients were included in the study (14 PR only, nine PR+SMS, 11 control). Compared with patients in usual care, patients in the PR only group had a significant reduction in BMI and significant improvements in asthma control, exercise capacity and aerobic capacity after 3 months. These improvements persisted during 12 months of follow-up. No difference in ACQ between PR+SMS and PR only groups was observed. However, users of the SMS programme had a significantly lower BMI after 12 months compared with subjects in the PR only group. A high-intensity pulmonary rehabilitation programme provides sustained improvements in asthma control, body composition and exercise capacity in obese asthmatics that are not optimally controlled and, therefore, should be considered in the treatment of these patients.|[{'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'exercise capacity', 'dis': 'Asthma', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'exercise capacity', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Asthma', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'aerobic capacity', 'dis': 'Asthma', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'aerobic capacity', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'pulmonary rehabilitation', 'out': 'exercise capacity', 'dis': 'Asthma', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'pulmonary rehabilitation', 'out': 'exercise capacity', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'pulmonary rehabilitation', 'out': 'aerobic capacity', 'dis': 'Asthma', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'pulmonary rehabilitation', 'out': 'aerobic capacity', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'exercise capacity', 'dis': 'Asthma', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'exercise capacity', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Asthma', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'aerobic capacity', 'dis': 'Asthma', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'aerobic capacity', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'diet', 'out': 'exercise capacity', 'dis': 'Asthma', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'diet', 'out': 'exercise capacity', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'diet', 'out': 'rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Asthma', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'diet', 'out': 'rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'diet', 'out': 'aerobic capacity', 'dis': 'Asthma', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'diet', 'out': 'aerobic capacity', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}]

From 230 individuals that were contacted, 39 (17%) attended the evaluation session and 22 (9.6%) were recruited in the study, 11 in each group (control and experimental). The main source of recruitment was other research projects (43.5%). The main reason for exclusion was unavailability (22%). Six out of 39 individuals (15.4%) that attended in the evaluation session were not able to perform the cardiopulmonary exercise testing. All subjects included showed a respiratory exchange ratio ≥1.0 (considered as maximal effort in the CPET). Retention rate was 81% and the main reason of withdrawal was unavailability (75%). The overall attendance rate was 88% and the main reason for non-attendance was illness/sickness (20.8%). The adherence rate was 99% and the reasons for non-completing sessions were illness/sickness (60%) or delay (40%). No serious adverse events occurred. Recruitment rate was low, retention rate was moderate, attendance and adherence rates were high. No serious adverse events occurred. It was feasible and safe to execute a randomized clinical trial that performed cardiopulmonary exercise testing and 12 weeks of aerobic treadmill training.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'adherence', 'dis': 'Stroke', 'eff': 3}]

Lifestyle interventions are effective to treat MetS, however, there are periods during the year in which exercise programs are discontinued and improper dietary habits reappear (e.g., Christmas holidays). We aimed to analyze if exercise-training during Christmas holidays would avoid body-weight gains and cardiometabolic deterioration in MetS individuals, using a randomized control trial. Thirty-eight men with MetS undergoing exercise training were randomly allocated to either continue (TRAIN group, n = 16) or discontinue (HOLID group, n = 22) training, during the three weeks of Christmas. Anthropometrics (body weight, fat, and waist circumference), fasting blood metabolites (glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and cholesterol concentrations) and exercise maximal fat oxidation (FO MAX ) and oxygen uptake (VO 2PEAK ) were determined before and after Christmas. Both groups were similar at baseline in all parameters ( p > 0.05). HOLID group increased body weight (91.3 ± 13.0 to 92.0 ± 13.4 kg, p = 0.004), mean arterial pressure (94.0 ± 10.6 to 97.1 ± 8.9 mmHg, p = 0.026), blood insulin (10.2 ± 3.8 to 12.5 ± 5.4 µIU·mL -1 , p = 0.003) and HOMA (3.2 ± 1.3 to 4.1 ± 2.3, p = 0.003). In contrast, TRAIN prevented those disarrangements and reduced total (170.6 ± 30.6 to 161.3 ± 31.3 mg·dL -1 , p = 0.026) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (i.e., LDL- C , 104.8 ± 26.1 to 95.6 ± 21.7 mg·dL -1 , p = 0.013). TRAIN also prevented the reductions in exercise FO MAX and VO 2PEAK that was observed in the HOLID group ( p = 0.002). In conclusion, exercise training during Christmas, prevents body weight gains and the associated cardiovascular (increase in blood pressure and LDL -C ) and metabolic (reduced insulin sensitivity) health risks are an optimal non-pharmacological therapy for that period of the year.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'mortality', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'all-cause mortality', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'blood pressure', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'intra-abdominal fat', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cholesterol', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'arterial pressure', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}]

The aim of this study was to examine the impact of exercising immediately before or after a meal on EI, appetite sensations and food reward (FR) in adolescents with obesity. Seventeen adolescents with obesity completed 3 experimental sessions (randomized controlled trial): rest + lunch (CON); exercise + lunch (EX-MEAL); lunch + exercise (MEAL-EX). The exercise consisted of cycling 30 min at 65%V̇O 2peak . Outcomes included ad libitum EI (weighed lunch and dinner), FR (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire at pre- and post-combination of exercise/rest and lunch, and pre-dinner) and appetite sensations (visual analogue scales). EI was not different between conditions. Compared with CON, relative EI at lunch was lower in EX-MEAL and MEAL-EX (p ≤ 0.05) and daily only in MEAL-EX (p < 0.01). Postprandial fullness was higher in EX-MEAL compared to CON. Compared with CON, both EX-MEAL and MEAL-EX attenuated the increase in wanting for sweet food and reduced explicit liking for fat. These preliminary results suggest that exercising immediately before or after a meal produce few differences in appetite and have small beneficial effects on overall energy balance in adolescents with obesity, as well as on FR.

Male ob/ob mice were randomly divided into sedentary (n=7) and trained (n=7) groups. Aerobic training consisted of 5 weekly sessions, 60 min per session at 60% of the maximum speed of the running test. Hepatic and pancreatic samples were collected to evaluate histological features and gene expression associated with insulin resistance and inflammatory response after 8-week experiment protocol. RNA was performed by TRIzol ® . PCR experiments were performed using the Rotor-Gene RG-3000. Parametric data were assessed by t -test, one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons. Non-parametric data were assessed by the Mann-Whitney tests with Dunn's post-test of multiple comparisons. Histological analysis was assessed by chi-square test with Fisher's exact test. Significant variables were considered when p<0.05. All the analyses were performed by GraphPad Prism V6.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc.). Reductions in bodyweight (p = 0.008), weight evolution (p = 0.03), food intake (p <0.0001) and fat content were observed in trained group. Moreover, the trained group showed better results in peak velocity ( p =0.03) physical effort tolerance (p=0.006) and distance (p=0.01). Gene expression showed differences in IL-10 (p=0.03) and GLUT-2 (p=0.03) in hepatic analysis, between groups. Pancreatic gene expression showed difference between groups in IRS-2 (p=0.004), GLUT-2 (p=0.03) and IL-10 (p=0.008) analysis. Also, the trained group showed lower values for interlobular fat and inflammatory infiltrate in histological analysis when compared to sedentary animals. An 8-week physical training protocol was able to attenuate bodyweight gain, food intake and generate positive effects on gene expression related to insulin resistance and inflammation in both liver and pancreas of ob/ob mice.|[{'npi': 'running', 'out': 'insulin resistance', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'running', 'out': 'inflammation', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'running', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'running', 'out': 'weight gain', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'running', 'out': 'velocity', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'insulin resistance', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'inflammation', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'weight gain', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'velocity', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'insulin resistance', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'inflammation', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight gain', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'velocity', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}]

The effects of TC on blood oxygen level, and the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities by measuring Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1-NF-E2-related factor 2 (KEAP1-NRF2) signaling was investigated in patients who had lung cancer surgery. Methods Lung cancer patients after surgery were randomly allocated into an intervention (IG, received TC) or a control (CG, received routine nurse care) group. We measured serum oxidative factors and inflammatory cytokines, KEAP1 and NRF2 in peripheral blood leukocytes, forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEVi), forced vital capacity (FVC), pulse oxygen saturation (SPO2), and pain scores. Results After a 3-month intervention, TC appeared to significantly improve lung function by increasing the levels of KEAP1, NRF2, FVC, FEVi, and SPO2, and reducing pain scores (p < 0.05). TC increased the levels of antioxidant markers (superoxidase dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidases (GPx)) and anti-inflammatory factor (interleukin (IL)-10), and reduced the levels of malondialdehyde and inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), IL-1 and IL-6) (p < 0.05). The levels of KEAP1 and NRF2 had a strong relationship with the level of these oxidative and inflammatory markers (p < 0.05). Conclusions After a 3-month intervention, TC appeared to patient’s antioxidant and anti-inflammatory abilities possibly by affecting KEAP1-NRF2 signaling, and increasing blood oxygen level. The study may have some bias as follow up was short and size sample small. |[{'npi': 'tai chi', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'tai chi', 'out': 'inflammation', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'inflammation', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}]

The current work identifies perceptions on the acceptability of Intervention Group Participants (IGP) and Project Officers (POs) about the ""MOVEdiabetes"" intervention programme aimed at increasing PA in adults with type 2 diabetes in Oman (a retrospectively registered trial). The ""MOVEdiabetes"" programme (PA consultations, pedometers and WhatsApp messages) was delivered by the POs (primary health care practitioners) in four primary care centres within a one-year cluster randomised control trial. Recruitment and retention were measured from trial attendance records. Programme satisfaction, appropriateness, and content suitability were assessed using exit surveys for both the IGP (interview based) and POs (self-administered). Open text questions on perceptions to the study programme were also included. Participants were randomised to an intervention group (IG, n = 122) or comparison group (CG, n = 110). The overall retention rate at three and 12 months was 92.7% [110(90.2%) IG vs 105(95.5%) CG] and 75% [82(67.2%) IG vs 92(83.6%) CG] respectively. Most (n = 14, 87.5%) POs and more than half (n = 49, 59.8%) IGP perceived the programme as very appropriate and many reported that they were ""quite/ very satisfied"" with the programme (n = 16, 100% PO's and n = 71, 86.6% IGP). Two thirds (n = 55, 66.0%) of IGP were very/quite likely to recommend the programme to others. PA consultations, use of pedometers and Whatsapp messages were well perceived by all.

An acute bout of high intensity interval resistance training (HIIRT) increases acute resting energy expenditure (REE) and decreases respiratory ratio (RR), suggesting its potential role on weight loss and increased fatty acid oxidation. The aim of this study was to test the long-term effect of HIIRT on body composition, lipid profile and muscle strength using a randomized parallel trial. Twenty healthy young adults (22.15 1.95 years) were randomized to perform either a HIIRT ( N = 11) protocol, consisting of three sets of 6 repetitions at 6 repetition maximum (RM) and then 20 seconds of rest between repetitions until exhaustion repeated for 3 times with 2'30″ rest between sets or a traditional training (TRT, N = 9) protocol of 3 sets of 15 reps with 75 sec of rest between sets. Body composition, resting energy metabolism, aerobic capacity, muscle strength and blood measurements were taken before and after 8 weeks of training. Both protocols enhanced muscle strength, but only HIIRT improved endurance strength performance (+22.07%, p < 0.05) and lean body mass (+2.82%, p < 0.05). REE and RR were unaltered as lipid profile. HIIRT represents a valid training method to improve muscle strength and mass, but its role on body weight control was not confirmed.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'lean body mass', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'endurance', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'muscle strength', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'endurance', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'muscle strength', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'lean body mass', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}]

Despite worldwide research efforts, a cure for AD has not been identified. Thus, it is critical to identify preventive strategies that can reduce the risk of or delay the onset of AD. Physical activity (PA) has potential in this regard. This randomized clinical trial aims to (a) test the causal relationship between PA and AD-associated cognitive function for persons with a family history of AD (FH+), (b) determine the moderating role of apolipoprotein epsilon 4 (APOE4) carrier status on cognition, and (c) assess cerebral structure, cerebral function, and putative biomarkers as mediators of the effects of PA on cognition. We are recruiting cognitively normal, middle aged (40-65 years) sedentary adults with FH+. Participants are randomly assigned to a 12-month PA intervention for 3 days/week or to a control group maintaining their normal lifestyle. Saliva samples are taken at pre-test to determine APOE genotype. At pre-, mid-, and post-tests, participants complete a series of cognitive tests to assess information-processing speed, verbal and visual episodic memory, constructional praxis, mnemonic discrimination, and higher-order executive functions. At pre- and post-tests, brain imaging and blood biomarkers are assessed. We hypothesize that 1) the PA group will demonstrate improved cognition compared with controls; 2) PA-derived cognitive changes will be moderated by APOE4 status; and 3) PA-induced changes in neural and blood biomarkers will contribute to cognitive changes and differ as a function of APOE4 status. Our results may provide important insights into the potential of PA to preserve neurocognitive function in people with a heightened risk of AD due to FH+ and as moderated by APOE4 status. By using sophisticated analytic techniques to assess APOE as a moderator and neurobiological mechanisms as mediators across trajectories of cognitive change in response to PA, we will advance our understanding of the potential of PA in protecting against AD.

Studies evaluating treatments to reduce stress in patients with chronic pain are lacking. We aimed to quantify the effect of two evidence-based interventions for chronic low back pain (cLBP), yoga and physical therapy (PT), on perceived stress in adults with cLBP. We used data from an assessor-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial, which recruited predominantly low-income and racially diverse adults with cLBP. Participants (N = 320) were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of yoga, PT, or back pain education. We compared changes in the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) from baseline to 12- and 52-week follow-up among yoga and PT participants with those receiving education. Subanalyses were conducted for participants with elevated pre-intervention perceived stress (PSS-10 score ≥17). We conducted sensitivity analyses using various imputation methods to account for potential biases in our estimates due to missing data. Among 248 participants (mean age = 46.4 years, 80% nonwhite) completing all three surveys, yoga and PT showed greater reductions in PSS-10 scores compared with education at 12 weeks (mean between-group difference = -2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -4.5 to -0.66, and mean between-group difference = -2.4, 95% CI = -4.4 to -0.48, respectively). This effect was stronger among participants with elevated pre-intervention perceived stress. Between-group effects had attenuated by 52 weeks. Results were similar in sensitivity analyses.

The aim of this study was to investigate the acute and training induced effects of BFR-RT on hemostatic and hemodynamic responses in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Stable patients with CAD were randomized to 8 weeks of BFR-RT (30%-40% 1-repetition maximum unilateral knee extension) combined with aerobic training or aerobic training alone (control group). At baseline and after 4 and 8 weeks, blood samples were taken before and after BFR exercise, whereas hemodynamic parameters were monitored throughout the exercise. Twenty-four patients (12 per group; mean age, 60 ± 2 years; mostly male [75%]) completed the study. The BFR-RT significantly improved systolic blood pressure (-10 mm Hg; P = .020) and tended to lower diastolic blood pressure (-2 mm Hg; P = .066). In contrast, no posttraining alterations were observed in N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic hormone, fibrinogen, and D-dimer values. During BFR exercise, all hemodynamic variables significantly increased after the first and second set, whereas blood pressure immediately lowered after the cuff was released in the third set.

A group of healthcare workers participated voluntarily to a meeting about LBP and to be accepted, were randomly allocated to workplace program or to home-based exercises, illustrated in a booklet and in a video available on the company intranet website. Both programs consisted in 7 weeks of moderate intensity exercises adapted to LBP. Most outcomes improved in both groups, however with larger improvement of the Oswestry Disability Index in the workplace group (P = 0.02). Regular physical exercise, at home or at the workplace among healthcare workers with LBP, represents a great opportunity to improve health and reduce disability.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Back Pain', 'eff': 3}]

Although maximal strength training (MST) has the potential to counteract this debilitating outcome and is shown to be superior to low- and moderate-intensity strength training, it is unknown if it can elicit effective adaptations in patients suffering treatment-induced adverse side effects. Fifty-five newly diagnosed stage I to III breast cancer patients (49 ± 7 yr) scheduled for adjuvant therapy were randomized to MST or a control group. The MST group performed 4 × 4 repetitions of dynamic leg press at approximately 90% of one-repetition maximum (1RM) twice a week for 12 wk. In the MST group, improvements in 1RM (20% ± 8%; P < 0.001) were accompanied by improved walking economy (9% ± 8%) and increased time to exhaustion during incremental walking (9% ± 8%; both P < 0.01). Moreover, the MST group increased 6-min walking distance (6MWD; 10% ± 7%), and chair rising (30% ± 20%) and stair climbing performance (12% ± 7%; all P < 0.001). All MST-induced improvements were different from the control group (P < 0.01) which reduced their 1RM (9% ± 5%), walking economy (4% ± 4%), time to exhaustion (10% ± 8%), 6MWD (5% ± 5%), chair rising performance (12% ± 12%), and stair climbing performance (6% ± 8%; all P < 0.01). Finally, although MST maintained estimated quadriceps femoris muscle mass, a decrease was observed in the control group (7% ± 10%; P < 0.001). The change in 1RM correlated with the change in walking economy (r = 0.754), time to exhaustion (r = 0.793), 6MWD (r = 0.807), chair rising performance (r = 0.808), and stair climbing performance (r = 0.754; all P < 0.001). Lower-extremity MST effectively increases lower-extremity maximal muscle strength in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant therapy and results in improved work economy, functional performance, and maintenance of muscle mass. These results advocate that MST should be considered in breast cancer treatment.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'muscle mass', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'muscle mass', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}]

This exploratory analysis investigated whether exercise of different intensities leads to changes in self-reported musculoskeletal pain or symptoms of diabetic neuropathy in inactive individuals with type 2 diabetes. Thirty-two inactive adults with T2D (59% male, mean age 58.7 ± 9.1yrs, median HbA 1c 7.8%) were randomised to usual care (CON), supervised combined aerobic and resistance moderate-intensity continuous training (C-MICT), or supervised combined high-intensity interval training (C-HIIT). At baseline and 8-weeks, musculoskeletal and neuropathic pain were evaluated using a modified Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire and the Neuropathy Total Symptom Score-6 respectively. Quantitative sensory testing was used to determine thermal, mechanical and vibration detection thresholds, as well as pain pressure thresholds. Adverse events were recorded throughout the intervention. Compared to CON, reduction in musculoskeletal pain intensity was significantly greater for C-HIIT (MD -5.4, 95% CI [-10.6 to -0.2], p = 0.04) and non-significantly greater for C-MICT (MD -5.9 [-12.4 to 0.7], p = 0.08). Changes in neuropathy symptoms were not different between C-HIIT and CON (MD 1.0 [-0.9 to 2.8], p = 0.31), or C-MICT and CON (MD 0.2 [-3.1 to 3.6], p = 0.89). No differences in sensory function were observed between groups. Similar rates of adverse events were seen in both exercise interventions (19 C-HIIT; 17 C-MICT), all but one of which were mild. Preliminary data suggests 8-weeks of high-intensity combined aerobic and resistance exercise may be safely prescribed for inactive individuals with T2D and may reduce musculoskeletal pain but not neuropathic symptoms.

A total of 87 post-menopausal volunteer women, aged 60-68 years, with mild knee OA were recruited in a randomized, controlled, 4-month aquatic training trial (RCT) and randomly assigned to an intervention (n = 43) and a control (n = 44) group. The intervention group participated in 48 supervised aquatic resistance training sessions over 4 months while the control group maintained their usual level of physical activity. Additionally, 77 participants completed the 12-month post-intervention follow-up period. Self-assessed symptoms were estimated using the OA-specific Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and Health-related Quality of life (HRQoL) using the generic Short-form Health Survey (SF-36). After 4 months of aquatic resistance training, there was a significant decrease in the stiffness dimension of WOMAC -8.5 mm (95% CI = -14.9 to -2.0, P = .006) in the training group compared to the controls. After the cessation of the training, this benefit was no longer observed during the 12-month follow-up. No between-group differences were observed in any of the SF-36 dimensions. The results of this study show that participation in an intensive aquatic resistance training program did not have any short- or long-term impact on pain and physical function or quality of life in women with mild knee OA. However, a small short-term decrease in knee stiffness was observed.|[{'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Osteoarthritis', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'physical functioning', 'dis': 'Osteoarthritis', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Osteoarthritis', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'physical functioning', 'dis': 'Osteoarthritis', 'eff': 1}]

Outcome Measures:             Participants in the focus groups were asked to provide feedback on their experiences with the study as well as the benefits of their t'ai chi practice. We used demographic and class attendance data to describe the sample.               Results:             Regarding the benefits of t'ai chi practice, five major themes were identified: functional benefits, pain reduction/pain relief, psychospiritual benefits, the importance of social support in learning t'ai chi , and the integration of t'ai chi into daily activities. The most common functional benefits were improvements in balance, flexibility, leg strength, and posture. Some reported pain reduction or pain relief, but others did not. Increased relaxation, mindfulness, and a sense of connectedness were subthemes that emerged from psychospiritual benefits. Social support benefits included motivation to attend class and group support while learning a new skill. Finally, improved body awareness allowed participants to integrate t'ai chi skills into their daily activities.

Impaired cognitive function in RA is an important associated factor, although it has been less well-recognized. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a specifically designed exercise programme on body composition, aerobic capacity, muscle strength and cognition in RA. Sixty-six patients with RA were randomized to a specifically designed, personalized exercise programme or standard care. Assessments included body composition, fitness, grip strength and cognitive testing, in addition to disease related measures. Significant improvements in C-reactive protein (p = 0.025), fatigue scores (p = 0.047) and truncal fat (p = 0.004) were observed in the exercise group compared with controls. Median waist circumference was significantly reduced (94.0 to 91.4 cm, p < 0.0001). Improvements were also seen in aerobic capacity (23.2 to 27.6 ml/kg/min, p = 0.002) and in median right (12.0 to 13.0 kg, p = 0.025) and left grip strength (8.0 to 10 kg, p = 0.005). Cognitive function improved in the exercise group, with median Montreal Cognitive Assessment score 25.5 at 0 months compared to 28.0 at 3 months (p = 0.001). This study demonstrates that exercise has a significant and positive impact on cognitive function in RA. Furthermore, physical activity is safe and effective in chronic inflammatory joint disease and is recommended as a vital component in the holistic management of these patients.Key Points• A dedicated physical exercise programme is feasible and safe in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).• Physical exercise helps reduce fatigue scores and improves cardiovascular fitness in stable RA patients.• Physical exercise has a positive impact on cognition in patients with RA.• A structured exercise programme should be an integral part of chronic disease management protocols for patients with RA.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'fatigue', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'intra-abdominal fat', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'aerobic capacity', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'muscle strength', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'grip strength', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cognitive function', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cognition', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cardiovascular fitness', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}]

Lumbar stabilization and stretching exercises are recommended to treat low back pain in the general population. However, few studies have applied the effects of these two interventions in pregnant women with low back pain. To compare the effects of lumbar stabilization and stretching exercises for the treatment of gestational low back pain. A pilot randomized clinical trial. Laboratory of Functional Evaluation and Human Motor Performance and physical therapy clinics. Initially, 30 pregnant women with low back pain were recruited, of which 24 met the following inclusion criteria: being between 19-29 weeks of gestation; being in prenatal clinical follow-up; having nonspecific mechanical low back pain started in pregnancy; not participating in specific low back pain treatment in the last 3 months. A total of 20 women completed the study (10 each group). The main outcome measures were clinical (pain by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and McGill Pain Questionnaire and disability by Roland Morris Questionnaire), and secondary outcome measures were: postural balance (force platform); muscle activation level of multifidus, iliocostalis lumborum, rectus abdominis and external abdominal oblique (electromyography). The women were randomized into two groups for 6 weeks of intervention twice a week for a 50-minute treatment: 1) lumbar stabilization exercise protocol and 2) stretching exercise protocol. There was a significant reduction (P=0.03) in pain (1.68 in VAS and 4.81 for McGill questionnaire) for both interventions, but no change in disability score. In addition, both interventions were comparable for a significant improvement in postural stability (in mean d=0.77) for the velocity sway parameter, and significantly increased activation (P>0.05) of the external abdominal oblique muscle after intervention. Both modalities (lumbar stabilization and stretching) were efficient for pain reduction, improving balance and increasing one trunk activity muscle after 6 weeks of intervention in pregnant women with low back pain. The present study has implications, especially for clinical decision-making with regard to therapy choice in pregnant women with LBP to reduce pain and improve trunk function as measured through balance performance.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Back Pain', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'balance', 'dis': 'Back Pain', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'balance performance', 'dis': 'Back Pain', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Back Pain', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'balance', 'dis': 'Back Pain', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'balance performance', 'dis': 'Back Pain', 'eff': 3}]

The aim of this study was to examine effectiveness of a 12-week multicomponent exercise (ME) with remote guidance intervention on health-related outcomes after one year among breast cancer patients. Methods : In phases I-III, 60 patients (51.2 ± 7.9 years) with breast cancer (BC) who completed chemotherapy/postoperative radiotherapy within the previous four months to two years were randomly assigned to 1) multicomponent exercise with remote guidance (ME) and 2) usual care (UC). Eligible participants were approached to assess cancer-related quality of life (QOL), muscle strength, cardiorespiratory endurance, and physical activity (PA) barriers after one year. Results : The results demonstrated that, after one year, the ME group reported higher vitality-related QOL (5.776, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.987, 10.565, effect size [ES] = 0.360), mental health-related QOL (9.938, 95% CI 4.146, 15.729, ES = 0.512), leg strength and endurance (2.880, CI 1.337, 4.423, ES = 0.557), and strength and endurance of upper extremities (2.745, 95% CI 1.076, 4.415, ES = 0.491) and lower physical activity (PA) hindrance (5.120, 95% CI 1.976, 8.264, ES = 0.486) than the UC group.

Sixty-nine previously inactive men and women (32.8 ± 8.2 years) were genotyped and underwent a 12-week aerobic (running/walking) training program (3-5 sessions, 40 - 60 min per session, and intensity between the aerobic and anaerobic threshold) (experimental group n = 53) or were part of the control group ( n = 16). They were tested for aerobic capacity (ergospirometry), body composition (DXA), abdomen, waist and hip circumferences and nutritional assessment before and 48 h after the experimental protocol. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA test was used to verify possible differences in variables between the experimental vs. control groups or Pro/Pro vs. Pro/Ala groups, and the Chi-squared test was used to verify the distribution of responders and non-responders according to genotype ( p < 0.05). Frequencies of 75.5% Pro/Pro ( n = 40) and 24.5% Pro/Ala ( n = 13) were found, without any occurrence of the recessive homozygote. Body fat reduction was initially confirmed compared to a control group which did not exercise ( n = 16; 29.1 ± 8.8 years), so that the exercise group obtained a reduction of -1.3 kg vs. -0.3 kg in the control group ( p = 0.03). When they were divided by genotype, there were significant changes in fat mass (-1.3 ± 2.1 kg; p = 0.00), lean mass (0.6 ± 1.5 kg; p = 0.02), fat percentage (-1.3 ± 1.6; p = 0.00), waist circumference (-2.2 ± 2.9 cm; p = 0.00), abdomen circumference (-3.3 ± 3.6 cm; p = 0.00) and hip circumference (-2.7 ± 2.7 cm; p = 0.00) for Pro/Pro genotypes; and fat mass (-1.1 ± 1.7 kg; p = 0.04), fat percentage (-0.9 ± 1.5; p = 0.04), abdomen circumference (-3.9 ± 3.5 cm; p = 0.00) and hip circumference (-1.8 ± 1.8 cm; p = 0.00) for Pro/Ala genotypes, without any group interaction differences. The Chi squared test revealed no differences in the distribution of responders or non-responders according to genotype.

There are various reports of the success of high-intensity aerobic interval training (HI-AIT) and inspiratory muscle training (IMT) in the management of chronic heart failure patients. This study tested the hypothesis that the combination of HI-AIT and IMT could result in additional benefits over the IMT and the HI-AIT alone in terms of inspiratory muscle function, exercise capacity, and quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure and inspiratory muscle weakness. Forty patients with ejection fraction ≤45% and inspiratory muscle weakness described by maximal inspiratory pressure <70% predicted, underwent three exercise training sessions per week for 12 weeks. Patients were randomly allocated to one of four groups: the HI-AIT group, the IMT group, the combined (HI-AIT & IMT) group, and the control group. Before and after completing their training period, all patients underwent different tests that are mentioned above. No changes were detected in the control group. However, the combined group, when compared to HI-AIT and IMT groups, respectively, resulted in additional significant improvement in maximal inspiratory training (62%, 24%, 25%), exercise time (62%, 29%, 12%), the 6-minute walk test (23%, 15%, 18%), and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (56%, 47%, 36%). In patients with chronic heart failure and inspiratory muscle weakness, the combination of the HI-AIT and the IMT resulted in additional benefits in respiratory muscle function, exercise performance, and quality of life compared to that of HI-AIT or IMT alone.

We analyzed baseline data from 346 young adults (23.3 ± 4.4 yr) participating in the Healthy Body Healthy U clinical trial from 2015 to 2018. Cardiometabolic risk factors were measured according to standard procedures and moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) was determined by accelerometry. A cardiometabolic clustering score (ranging from 0 to 5) was created from five biomarkers according to whether or not a standard clinical risk cut point was exceeded (0, no; 1, yes): abdominal circumference (>102 cm (men) or >88 cm (women)), hemoglobin A1c (≥5.7%), HDL cholesterol (<40 mg·dL (men) or <50 mg·dL (women)), systolic blood pressure (≥130 mm Hg), and diastolic blood pressure (≥85 mm Hg). Cardiometabolic dysregulation (CD) was defined as a cardiometabolic clustering score ≥3. Multiple logistic regression determined the independent association between level of MVPA and CD, while adjusting for sex, race/ethnicity, sedentary time, and smoking. The prevalence of CD was 18% (22% in men, 17% in women). We observed a nonlinear graded association between MVPA and CD. Participants performing 150-300 min·wk of MVPA significantly lowered their odds of CD by 66% (odds ratio, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.16-0.75), whereas those exceeding 300 min·wk lowered their odds by 61% (odds ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.86) compared with those performing <150 min·wk, independent of obesity and the other covariables. Recommended levels of moderate-intensity physical activity is significantly associated with lower odds of CD and thus may prevent or diminish the need for expensive pharmaceutical treatment over the remainder of the life-span.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cardio-metabolic risk', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}]

The aim of this subanalysis of an adjunctive nutraceutical randomized controlled trial for the treatment of bipolar depression was to explore the relationship between PA, the active adjunctive treatments (a nutraceutical ""mitochondrial cocktail""), and clinical outcomes. Participants with bipolar depression were randomized to receive N -acetylcysteine alone, N -acetylcysteine with a combination of nutraceuticals (chosen for the potential to increase mitochondrial activity), or placebo for 16 weeks. Participants ( n = 145) who completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF; measured at Week 4) were included in this exploratory subanalysis. Assessments of BD symptoms, functioning, and quality of life were completed at monthly visits up until Week 20. Generalised Estimating Equations were used to explore whether IPAQ-SF scores were a moderator of treatment received on outcomes of the study. Week-4 PA was not related to changes in Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores across the study until Week 20. However, participants who engaged in more PA and who received the combination treatment were more likely to have a reduction in scores on the Bipolar Depression Rating Scale ( P = 0.03). However, this was not consistent in all domains explored using the IPAQ-SF. Participants who engaged in higher levels of PA also experienced greater improvement in social and occupational functioning and less impairment in functioning due to their psychopathology and improvement in quality of life at Week 20, irrespective of treatment. This study provides novel evidence of the association between PA and reduction in BD symptoms in a nutraceutical clinical trial. However, further research assessing the potential synergistic effects of PA in BD is required."|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'depression', 'dis': 'Depression', 'eff': 3}]

The aim of this study was to identify the effects of elastic resistance exercise training after total knee replacement on muscle mass and physical outcomes in older women with knee osteoarthritis. Sixty older women who received unilateral primary total knee replacement surgery were randomized to an experimental group, which received 12 wks of postoperative elastic resistance exercise training, or a control group, which received standard care. The outcome measures included physical function performance (ie, Timed Up & Go, gait speed, forward reach, single-leg stance, timed chair rise), appendicular lean mass, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. The assessment time points were 2 wks before surgery (T0), 1 mo after surgery (T1, before resistance exercise training), and 4 mos after surgery (T2, upon completion of resistance exercise training). After 12 wks of postoperative elastic resistance exercise training, the experimental group exhibited a significantly greater change in appendicular lean mass (mean difference = 0.81 kg, P = 0.004) than the control group. Elastic resistance exercise training also exerted significant effects on Timed Up & Go and gait speed with mean differences of 0.28 m/sec (P < 0.001) and -2.66 secs (P < 0.001), respectively.

Thirty untrained healthy men were recruited for the study and 23 were included in the final analysis. Participants were randomly assigned to exercise and sleep optimization: ExS (N.=10) or exercise only: Ex (N.=12). Both groups performed a whole-body resistance exercise program twice a week for 10 weeks. The ExS group received sleep health (SH) education on how to improve both sleep quantity and quality. After 10 weeks of training both groups had increased lean body mass by a similar amount. The ExS group experienced an increase of 1.7±1.1 kg while the Ex group experienced an increase of 1.3±0.8 kg (P=0.29 for difference between groups). The men in the ExS group reduced fat mass significantly (-1.8±0.8 kg) while the Ex group did not (0.8±1.0 kg). P value was 0.02 for difference between groups. This randomized controlled trial suggests that combining regular resistance exercise training with optimization of sleep health provide significant added benefits to body composition. This optimization provides a simple and cheap tool, applicable to the general healthy population.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'fat mass', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'lean body mass', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'fat mass', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'lean body mass', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}]

This study investigated the influence of 8 weeks of CT order on body composition and serum concentrations of FLST, MSTN, their ratio (F:M) and GDF11 in sarcopenic elderly men. Thirty sarcopenic elderly men (age = 64.3 ± 3.5 years) were randomly assigned into one of three groups, endurance followed by resistance training (E + R; n = 10), resistance followed by endurance training (R + E; n = 10) or control (C; n = 10). Serum concentrations of muscle regulatory markers, body composition, maximum rate of oxygen consumption (VO 2max ), and upper and lower body strength were evaluated at baseline and after 8 weeks. The training protocol consisted of three training sessions per week for eight weeks. There were significant group-by-time interactions (P < 0.05) for FLST, MSTN, GDF11 and F:M ratio. FLST (E + R = 187 pg/mL and R + E = 292 pg/mL) and F:M ratio (E + R = 0.20 and R + E = 0.27) significantly increased (P < 0.05) while MSTN (E + R = -308 pg/mL and R + E = -294 pg/mL) and GDF11 (E + R = -12 pg/mL and R + E = -10 pg/mL) significantly decreased (P < 0.05) following eight weeks in the E + R and R + E compared to no changes in the C group. In addition, there were significant group x time interactions (P < 0.01) for weight, BMI, body fat percentage (BFP), skeletal muscle mass (SMM), VO 2max , upper body strength, and lower body strength. BFP (E + R = -1.5% and R + E = -2%) significantly decreased (P < 0.01) while weight (E + R = 2.4 kg and R + E = 1.1 kg), BMI (E + R = 0.8 kg/m 2 and R + E = 0.3 kg/m 2 ), SMM (E + R = 0.7 kg and R + E = 0.5 kg), VO 2max (E + R = 2.0 mL/kg/min and R + E = 1.8 mL/kg/min), upper body strength (E + R = 6.9 kg and R + E = 2.3 kg), and lower body strength (E + R = 9.8 kg and R + E = 4.4 kg) significantly increased (P < 0.01) in the E + R and R + E compared to no changes in the C group. CT increases the F:M ratio and FLST as well as reducing MSTN and GDF11 in sarcopenic elderly men. Additionally, CT improved weight, body composition, muscle mass, function, and aerobic fitness. Notably, these results after CT were achieved irrespective of endurance and resistance exercise order in this population.|[{'npi': 'endurance training', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'endurance training', 'out': 'muscle mass', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'endurance training', 'out': 'aerobic fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'endurance training', 'out': 'endurance', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'endurance training', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'muscle mass', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'aerobic fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'endurance', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'muscle mass', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'aerobic fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'endurance', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}]

Water-walking decreases musculoskeletal impact and risk of falls in older individuals, but it is unclear whether water-walking improves aerobic fitness in the same way as weight-dependent land-walking. This randomized controlled trial involved 3 intervention groups-a no-exercise control group (CG), a land-walking (LW) group, and a water-walking (WW) group-to investigate the comparative impacts of LW and WW to CG on fitness. Both exercise groups attended individually tailored, center-based, intensity-matched 3×weekly sessions for 24 weeks, which progressed to 150 min of exercise per week. This was followed by a 24-week no-intervention period. Maximal graded exercise tests were performed on a treadmill at Weeks 0, 24, and 48. Maximal oxygen uptake increased from Week 0 to Week 24 in both exercise groups (0.57 ± 0.62 mL/kg/min, 0.03 ± 0.04 L/min for LW; 0.93 ± 0.75 mL/kg/min, 0.06 ± 0.06 L/min for WW, mean ± SE) compared to the CG (-1.75 ± 0.78 mL/kg/min, -0.16 ± 0.05 L/min) (group×time, p < 0.05). Time to exhaustion increased significantly following LW only (123.4 ± 25.5 s), which was significantly greater (p=0.001) than the CG (24.3 ± 18.5 s). By Week 48, the training-induced adaptations in the exercise groups returned to near baseline levels. Our study supports current physical-activity recommendations that 150 min/week of moderate-intensity exercise produces improvements in fitness in previously sedentary older individuals. Also, LW and WW elicit similar improvements in fitness if conducted at the same relative intensities. Exercise-naïve older individuals can benefit from the lower impact forces and decreased risk of falls associated with WW without compromising improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'aerobic fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'falls', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'aerobic fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'falls', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}]

The PEACH study was a single center, parallel-group, clinical trial that randomized 30 clinical stable Chagas HD patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <45% or heart failure symptoms to either supervised exercise training 3 times/week for 6 months or a control group. Both groups had the same monthly pharmaceutical and nutritional counseling and usual care. Primary end point was functional capacity assessed by peak exercise oxygen consumption (peak VO 2 ) obtained by cardiopulmonary exercise test. Secondary end points included other cardiopulmonary exercise test variables, cardiac function by echocardiography, body composition, muscle respiratory strength, and metabolic biomarkers. Peak VO 2 increased among patients in exercise group from 17.60 ± 4.65 mlO 2 kg -1 min -1 to 19.40 ± 5.51 mlO 2 kg -1 min -1 while decreased in controls from 15.40 ± 6.30 mlO 2 kg -1 min -1 to 12.96 ± 4.50 mlO 2 kg -1 min -1 , resulting in significant difference in change in peak VO 2 between groups after 6 months (β=+4.6, p=0.004). There were significant differences between groups in changes in anaerobic threshold (β=3.7, p=0.05), peak oxygen pulse (β=+2.7, p=0.032) and maximum minute ventilation (β=+13.9, p < 0.0001) after 6 months of intervention.

After-school programs (ASP) might provide opportunities for young schoolchildren to participate in PA. The aim of the current study was to investigate the PA of first graders in ASP and to consider its contribution to the development of motor competencies and the learning of movements. The study was performed utilizing a mixed methods design. A total of 42 first graders were sampled from 14 ASPs in Norway. Direct observations of the children's activities were conducted for the duration of one entire ASP day. PA intensity was measured using ActiGraph accelerometers. Qualitative data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis, while the Mann-Whitney U test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to analyze the quantitative data. The median PA time among the observed children was 61.5 minutes. The median stationary time was 75.9 minutes. There was considerable variation within the sample. Girls were significantly more engaged in stationary behavior than boys. Frequent changes in activity type and intensity were typical features of the children's ASP day. PA duration and intensity were significantly higher outdoors than indoors. Adult-managed time had longer periods of stationary behavior than child-managed time. The PA at all intensity levels contained barrier-breaking movements-especially at light intensity levels. Most of the first graders studied were engaged in a variety of activity types of different duration and intensity levels, favorable for the development of motor competencies and for the learning of movements. Hence, it is reasonable to highlight that light PA, in combination with moderate and vigorous PA, is also of great importance for children during the time they spend in ASP. Ultimately, there is a need for staff members who can also stimulate varied PA among the most stationary children.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'learning', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'health education', 'out': 'learning', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}]

Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify social-ecological correlates of PA 4 years post-baseline. The final model revealed that lower baseline physical fatigue (β = -0.25, 95% CI -0.26; -0.24) and higher baseline total PA (0.06, 95% CI, 0.03; 0.10) were correlated with higher total PA levels 4 years post-baseline. Higher baseline leisure and sport PA (0.02, 95% CI 0.01; 0.03), more recreational facilities within a buffer of 1 km (4.05, 95% CI = 1.28; 6.83), lower physical fatigue at 4-year follow-up (-8.07, 95% CI -14.00; -2.13), and having a positive change in physical fatigue during the intervention period (0.04, 95% CI 0.001; 0.07) were correlates of sport and leisure PA levels 4 years post-baseline. This study suggests that baseline and 4-year post-baseline physical fatigue, and past exercise behaviour, were significant correlates of PA 4 years after participation in an exercise trial. Additionally, this study suggests that the built environment should be taken into account when promoting PA. Understanding of socio-ecological correlates of PA can provide insights into how future exercise interventions should be designed to promote long-term exercise behaviour.

Material and method: randomized, controlled, parallel clinical trial that compared 3 arms, multicenter study in overweight or obese patients with a follow-up of 12 months. The patients were randomized into three groups: Intervention in the primary care center with G1 intervention: Control group, which received the usual recommendations to lose weight following the SEEDO 2000 Consensus. G2: Motivational intervention of obesity (IMOAP) with trained nurse and small periodic work groups. G3: Motivational intervention of obesity (IMOAP) adding the use of a digital platform that allows physical activity to be recorded, monitored and at the same time favors the practice of this (iwopi). Variables were collected: weight, height, BMI, circumference of the waist, lipid parameters, blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin. Results: 185 patients were initially included in the study. Seventeen patients left the study. Thus, 168 patients completed the study: 47 in G1, 61 in G2 and 60 in G3. Of the population studied, 57.1% were women. observing a general average weight reduction at the end of the study of 4.37 kg, being 5.34 kg in the group 2.6.29 kg in the group 3 and 1.25 kg in the control group (G1). It was also observed that cholesterol levels in three groups were reduced. at did not reach a statistically significant value. The clinically relevant parameters were: group 1 (control) versus group 2 (IMOAP): relative risk (RR), 0.10 to 0.46; relative risk reduction (RRR), 0.54 to 0.90; absolute risk reduction (ARR), from 0.30 to 0.61; number needed to treat (NNT), 3 to 2. Group 1 versus group 3 (IMOAP-PA): RR, 0.07 to 0.30; RRR, 0.70 to 0.93; ARR, 0.61 to 0.86; NNT: 2 to 1. Group 2 versus group 3: RR, 0.54 to 0.84; RRR, 0.16 to 0.46; ARR, 0.14 to 0.43; NNT, 7 to 2. Conclusions: The digital health platform that stimulates physical activity added to an interventionist motivation in overweight or obese patients is a significant additional benefit in terms of weight loss results, reduction of BMI and lipid profile in patients affected by overweight or obesity and a more effective cost.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight loss', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'lipid parameters', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'lipid profile', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cholesterol', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}]

Materials and Methods: Twenty adolescent (14-18 yrs) middle- and long-distance runners (11 males and 9 females; 16.7 ± 0.8 yrs), with at least two years of self-reported consistent run training, participated in this study. Eight of the subjects (4 females/4 males) constituted the control group, whereas twelve subjects (5 females/7 males) took part in a structured eleven-day altitude training camp, and training load was matched between groups. Primary variables of interest included changes in aerobic (VO 2 max) and anaerobic (30 s Wingate test) power. We also explored the relationships between running velocity and blood lactate levels before and after the altitude training camp. Results: Following 11 days of altitude training, desirable changes ( p < 0.01) in VO 2 max (+13.6%), peak relative work rate (+9.6%), and running velocity at various blood lactate concentrations (+5.9%-9.6%) were observed. Meanwhile, changes in Wingate anaerobic power (+5.1%) were statistically insignificant ( p > 0.05). Conclusions: Short duration altitude appears to yield meaningful improvements in aerobic but not anaerobic power in trained adolescent endurance runners.|[{'npi': 'endurance training', 'out': 'aerobic fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'running', 'out': 'aerobic fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'aerobic fitness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}]
32290148|10.3390/ijerph17072601|effects of aerobic-, anaerobic- and combined-based exercises on plasma oxidative stress biomarkers in healthy untrained young adults|International journal of environmental research and public health|2020-04-10|['Undefined']|['Adult']|['oxidative stress', 'stress']|Currently, it is well accepted that physical exercise-induced oxidative stress may damage biological structures and impair cellular functions. However, it is still unclear which type of exercise results in the greatest oxidative stress responses among a healthy untrained population. The aim of the present study was to compare the acute oxidative stress response (i.e., 0 to 20 min) following different types of exercise (anaerobic, aerobic, and combined). Ten healthy, untrained males (19.5 ± 1.7 years) performed three randomized exercise bouts: anaerobic (30 s Wingate test), aerobic (30 min at 60% maximal aerobic power (MAP)) or combined (anaerobic and aerobic). Venous blood samples were collected before, as well as at 0 (P0), 5 (P5), 10 (P10), and 20 (P20) min after each session. Rates of malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant activities (i.e., glutathione peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), α-tocopherol, and total antioxidant status (TAS)) were assessed. Independent of exercise type, plasma MDA, GPX, SOD, and GR contents increased above baseline, whereas plasma α-tocopherol decreased under baseline after the test sessions ( p < 0.05). Aerobic and anaerobic exercises generated faster responses (at P0) when compared to the combined exercise (P5 to P10) for the majority of the tested parameters. Plasma TAS content only increased following the aerobic exercise at P10 ( p = 0.03). Five to twenty-minutes post exercise, the highest MDA response was registered in the aerobic condition, and the highest GPX and SOD responses were recorded in the anaerobic (at P5) and aerobic (at P20) conditions ( p < 0.05). In conclusion, aerobic, anaerobic, or combined exercises have the potential to acutely increase oxidative stress and antioxidant activities, but with different responses magnitude. These findings confirm that oxidative stress response seems to be dependent on the intensity and the duration of the physical exercise and may help in understanding how varying exercise bouts influence the degree of oxidative stress among healthy untrained young adults.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'oxidative stress', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'oxidative stress', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}]

The aim was to compare different physical activity programs plus an individualized hypocaloric diet on body composition in overweight subjects. A randomized controlled clinical trial was carried out in overweight adults with no history of relevant illness. Primary outcome was total fat mass (TFM). Participants were allocated into four activity programs with equal intensity and volume of exercise for 22 weeks: strength training (S), endurance training (E), strength + endurance training (SE), and 'adhering to physical activity recommendations' (C). Participants followed a diet with 25% less energy (50%-55% carbohydrates, 30%-35% fat) measured by accelerometer. Variables were assessed at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. One hundred nineteen from 205 subjects were randomized in the four exercise groups (S = 30/E = 30/SE = 30/C = 29) and 84 participants (36 men/48 women) ended the intervention (S = 19/E = 25/SE = 22/C = 18). At the end of the experiment, all groups except C increased their total physical activity (S = 1159 ± 1740; E = 1625 ± 1790; SE = 1699 ± 2516; C = 724 ± 1979 MET-min/week). Using an ANOVA-test, improvements were observed in body weight (S = -4.6 ± 4.5; E = -6.6 ± 4.6; SE = -8.5 ± 2.8; C = -6.1 ± 5.6 kg, p = 0.059) and TFM (S = -4.24 ± 2.02; E = -4.74 ± 2.96; SE = -6.74 ± 3.27; C = -3.94 ± 4.18%; p < 0.05). The main conclusion was that there were no adverse events. Strength and endurance training with a balanced, individualized hypocaloric diet was the most effective at reducing weight loss and fat mass in overweight subjects.

Yet, despite the urgent need to find effective strategies for the treatment of pediatric obesity, only a few studies have addressed the impact of HIIT on eating behaviors and body composition in this population. This study aimed to compare the effect of HIIT versus MICT on eating behaviors in adolescents with obesity and to assess if the participants' baseline dietary status is associated with the success of the intervention. Forty-three adolescents with obesity were randomly assigned to a 16-week MICT or HIIT intervention. Body composition and 24-h ad libitum energy intake were assessed at baseline and at the end of the program. Restrained eating, emotional eating, and external eating were assessed using the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire at baseline. Both interventions led to significant weight, body mass index (BMI), and fat mass percentage (FM%) reductions, with better improvements in FM% in the HIIT group; whereas 24-h ad libitum energy intake increased to a similar extent in both groups. HIIT provides better body composition improvements over MICT, despite a similar increase in energy intake. Restrained eaters experienced less weight loss and smaller BMI reduction compared with unrestrained eaters; higher baseline cognitively restrained adolescents showed a greater increase of their ad libitum energy intake. Novelty HIIT favors better body composition improvements compared with MICT. Both MICT and HIIT increased ad libitum energy intake in adolescents with obesity. Weight loss achievement is better among unrestrained eaters.|[{'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'weight loss', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'fat mass', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'body mass index', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'weight loss', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'fat mass', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'body mass index', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 1}]

Twenty-nine strength-trained men (age = 26.1 ± 6.3 years, body mass [BM] = 74.2 ± 6.4 kg, and 15.9 ± 4.9 PU repetitions to failure) were randomly assigned to 2 groups: VL25 (n = 15) or VL50 (n = 14) and followed an 8-week (16 sessions) velocity-based BM prone-grip PU training program. Mean propulsive velocity (MPV) was monitored in all repetitions. Assessments performed at pre-training and post-training included estimated 1 repetition maximum; average MPV attained with all common external loads used during pre-training and post-training testing (AVinc); peak MPV lifting one's own BM (MPVbest); maximum number of repetitions to failure lifting one's own BM (MNR); and average MPV corresponding to the same number of repetitions lifting one's own BM performed during pre-training testing (AVMNR). VL25 attained significantly greater gains than VL50 in all analyzed variables except in MNR (P < 0.05). In addition, VL25 improved significantly (P < 0.001) in all the evaluated variables while VL50 remained unchanged. In conclusion, our results suggest that once a 25% velocity loss is achieved during PU training, further repetitions did not elicit additional gains and can even blunt the improvement in strength and endurance performance."|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'velocity', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 2}, {'npi': 'endurance training', 'out': 'velocity', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 2}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'velocity', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 2}]

Individuals maintained body weight within 3% of baseline. Pre/postphysical activity between-group measurements included body composition, calculated energy intake, TDEE, energy stores, and resting metabolic rate. Sixty weight-stable individuals completed the protocols. Exercise groups increased EEex in a stepwise manner compared with the observation group (P < .001). There was no group effect on changes in TDEE, energy intake, fat-free mass, or resting metabolic rate. Fat mass and energy stores decreased among the females in the high-exercise group (P = .007). The increase in EEex did not result in an equivalent increase in TDEE. There was a sex difference in the relationship among energy balance components. These results suggest a weight-independent compensatory response to exercise training with potentially a sex-specific adjustment in body composition.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'fat mass', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}]

Fourteen athletes, both continent and incontinent, between 18 and 30 years of age, were randomly assigned to an experimental group or a control group. The experimental group received a protocol for pelvic floor muscle training for 4 months. This consisted of three phases: awareness/stabilization, strength training and power. The control group was not subject to any intervention during the same period. Measures were collected at the initial and final phase for both groups. Maximum voluntary contractions were evaluated with a perineometer, involuntary urine loss with a Pad test and quality of life with the King's Health Questionnaire. Baseline sociodemographic and anthropometric characteristics were not significantly different. Comparing the two groups, the experimental group improved maximum voluntary pelvic contractions (p<0.001) and reduced urine loss (p=0.025), indicating the existence of significant differences between groups in the variation from the initial and final phases. The percentage of urine loss decreased in the experimental group, from 71.4-42.9%, suggesting that the protocol intervention for 16 weeks may help athletes with stress urinary incontinence.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'pelvic floor muscle training', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}]

A double-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled trial. Outpatient, Cairo University hospitals. Sixty patients with coccydynia randomized equally into kinesiotape plus exercise and sham kinesiotape plus exercise groups. The kinesiotape was worn for three days and replaced for three weeks. Each patient practiced exercises for three weeks. All patients were examined by visual analogue scale (VAS) for rating pain, Modified Modified Schober Test (MMST), and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). All outcomes were measured at baseline, three weeks postintervention, and four weeks follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences between groups at baseline ( P < 0.05), but there were statistically significant differences between groups for pain score, MMST, and ODI at post and follow-up data in favor of the kinesiotape group ( P < 0.001). For the three weeks postintervention, mean (SD) for pain score, MMST, and ODI was 33.07 ± 3.8, 6.6 ± 0.7, and 8.7 ± 2.1 in the study group and 39.9 ± 4.7, 5.8 ± 1.4, and 14.4 ± 2.7 in the control group, respectively.

J Strength Cond Res 34(4): 1008-1016, 2020-The purpose of this study was to compare the effects between single set vs. multiple sets of resistance training (RT) on measures of muscular strength, muscle mass, muscle quality (MQ), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in untrained healthy older women. Sixty-two older women were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups: single-set RT (SS, n = 21), multiple-sets RT (MS, n = 20), or nontraining control (CG, n = 21). Both training groups performed RT for 12 weeks, using 8 exercises of 10-15 repetitions maximum for each exercise. The SS group performed only 1 set per exercise, whereas MS performed 3 sets. Anthropometry, muscle strength (1RM tests), lean soft tissue (LST), and MQ from upper limbs (UL) and lower limbs (LL), and IGF-1 were measured before and after training. Both training groups showed significant pre-training to post-training increases for UL1RM (SS: 37.1%, MS: 27.3%, CG: -3.0%), LL1RM (SS: 16.3%, MS: 21.7%, CG: -0.7%), ULLST (SS: 7.8%, MS: 8.8%, CG: -1.1%), LLLST (SS: 5.6%, MS: 6.3%, CG: -0.8%), upper-limb muscle quality (SS: 25.2%, MS: 16.7%, CG: -0.2%), lower-limb muscle quality (SS: 10.5%, MS: 15.4%, CG: -3.5%), and IGF-1 (SS: +7.1%, MS: +10.1%, CG: -2.2%). We conclude that both SS and MS produce similar increases in muscular strength, LST, and MQ of upper and lower limbs, and IGF-1 after 12 weeks of RT in untrained older women. Our results suggest that, in the early stages, the RT regardless number of sets is effective for improving muscular outcomes in this population.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'muscle mass', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'muscle strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'muscle mass', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'muscle strength', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}]

Effects of combining running and practical duration stretching on proprioceptive skills of national sprinters. J Strength Cond Res 34(4): 1158-1165, 2020-Practical duration stretching after aerobic activities is a recommended component of the first part of warm-up because of its effects on performance. However, its effects on proprioceptive skills are unknown. This study aimed to analyze the effects of running and practical duration static stretching (SS) and dynamic stretching (DS) on postural balance and the joint position sense (JPS) of national sprinters. Thirty-two national sprinters were randomly classified into a SS group (n = 11), DS group (n = 11), or control group (n = 10). Static stretching performed 5 minutes of running and short-duration (20 seconds) static stretches; DS performed 5 minutes of running and short-duration dynamic (20 seconds) stretches; and the control group performed 5 minutes of running. Before and after the intervention, unipedal static postural balance and knee JPS were evaluated. Static stretching exhibited a more centralized center of pressure in the medial-lateral plane for unipedal static postural balance in right-leg support after stretching (p = 0.005, d = 1.24), whereas DS showed values further from the center after stretching for the same unipedal support compared with baseline (p = 0.042, d = 0.49), and the control group remained stable (p > 0.05). Joint position sense did not show significant differences in any group (p > 0.05). In conclusion, combining running and practical duration SS may be beneficial for right-leg postural stabilization, whereas DS may be partly and slightly deleterious. Both SS and DS combined with running and running alone have neutral effects on knee JPS. Sports professionals should consider running and practical duration SS as part of the warm-up of sprinters to partly improve unipedal static postural balance.|[{'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'balance', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'running', 'out': 'balance', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 2}, {'npi': 'sports', 'out': 'balance', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 2}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'balance', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 2}]

Randomized controlled trial METHODS: Sixty-one selected participants with KOA grades 2 and 3, 40-65 years old, and BMI < 30 kg/m 2 were randomized into three groups: CT, conventional strength training (ST), and educational protocol (EP). The CT and ST protocols consisted of 14-week training protocols conducted 3 times a week. The CT group performed exercises stratified as light, moderate, and intense, arranged progressively in a circuit model. The ST group performed conventional strength exercises, and the EP group participated in lectures twice a month about healthy lifestyles. Baseline and follow-up (week 0 and week 14) evaluations were conducted for thigh intermuscular fat (computed tomography), knee extension maximal isometric voluntary contraction (MIVC), and muscle quality (knee extension MIVC/muscle mass cross-sectional area). Only the CT group presented significant reductions in thigh intermuscular fat (p = 0.003) and significantly lower values in week 14 compared with the EP (p = 0.032). Both trained groups presented significant increases in muscle mass area (p=0.002 for CT and p=0.008 for ST) and increments in knee extension MIVC (p=0,033 for CT nd p=0.019 for ST) in week 14 compared with the EP and increases in muscle quality (p = 0.004 and 0.042). It can be concluded that a 14-week periodized CT protocol attenuates thigh intermuscular fat and improves muscle quality in patients with KOA.

A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted with a convenience sample of 90 patients aged between 45 and 82 years, who were recruited from three Community Health Posts (CHPs). The CHPs were randomized into two experimental groups (E1 and E2) and one control group (C). The intervention included health education and counseling combined with exercise classes based on the Interaction Model of Client Health Behavior. Trained community health nurse practitioners led the intervention. Stretching exercise (E1) and walking (E2) combined with muscle strengthening exercise were provided. The instruments included the Patient Activation Measure (PAM), Korean version of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (K-WOMAC), Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Scale (HAQDS), and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The HAQDS was measured using an ordinal scale, and Likert scales were used for the other instruments. Chi-square test and analysis of covariance were used; P values <.05 were considered significant. The study was conducted in 2014. The groups were similar at the baseline (P > .05) except for joint pain and patient activation (P < .05). At post-test, the changes in the mean scores were significant for joint pain and stiffness, and physical functioning. E2 with walking exercise showed better improvements in joint pain and physical functioning than the other groups (P < .01). Eight sessions of multifaceted intervention improved the osteoarthritis symptoms. Follow-up studies will be needed to determine the intermediate and long-term effects of the multifaceted intervention.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Osteoarthritis', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'joint pain', 'dis': 'Osteoarthritis', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'physical functioning', 'dis': 'Osteoarthritis', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Osteoarthritis', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'joint pain', 'dis': 'Osteoarthritis', 'eff': 3}]

It was developed in 4 community centers. Fifty-two sedentary, functionally independent individuals, aged 60 years or more, with MCI were randomized into intervention group (n = 26) and control group (n = 26). Participants were tested before and after a 24-week exercise program. Sociodemographic characteristics, cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination), conditioning (2-minute stationary walk test), lower-limb endurance (30-second sit/stand test), and balance data (Functional Reach test) were collected. The intervention group walked and exercised twice weekly (60 minutes each) using ankle weights, latex resistance bands, and dumbbells. The exercise load and intensity were regularly increased on the basis of a preestablished incremental number of sets and repetitions and on the basis of the participants' correct movement execution with a given load. Data were analyzed with Pearson χ test, Fisher exact test, Student t test, Mann-Whitney U test, 2-way repeated measures analysis of variance, and the Cohen d.

Given that little is known about exercise training in the large group of patients with mild to moderate COPD, we assessed the effectiveness of an exercise training programme in primary care. In this RCT, 90 patients with mild to moderate COPD (FEV 1 74.2 ± 13.5%pred) participated in a 4-month exercise training programme or control treatment. Primary outcome was improvement in functional exercise capacity, assessed by the 6-min walking distance (6MWD). Secondary outcomes were breathlessness (MRC dyspnoea score), disease-specific quality of life (CCQ, CRQ), muscle strength and objective daily physical activity. There was a follow-up measurement at 6 months. At 4 months, we found a statistically and clinically relevant between-group difference in 6MWD of +26.6 m (95% CI: 4,3-49.0, p = 0.020). Shoulder strength significantly improved with a between-group difference of 23.9 Nm (p = 0.0350). At 6 months, there was a significant improvement in handgrip force and CRQ sub score mastery of respectively 1.9 KgF (p = 0.028) and 0.5 (p = 0.035). There were no significant between-group differences in breathlessness, quality of life, knee strength and daily physical activity. The results indicate that exercise training in primary care is particularly effective in improving physical fitness (exercise capacity and strength), but not in breathlessness, health-related quality of life and daily physical activity. A broader assessment for COPD patients in primary care might be a necessary condition to offer the most effective intervention.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'exercise capacity', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'muscle strength', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'physical fitness', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'exercise capacity', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'muscle strength', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'physical fitness', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'exercise capacity', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'muscle strength', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'walking', 'out': 'physical fitness', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'pulmonary rehabilitation', 'out': 'exercise capacity', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'pulmonary rehabilitation', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'pulmonary rehabilitation', 'out': 'muscle strength', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'pulmonary rehabilitation', 'out': 'physical fitness', 'dis': 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive', 'eff': 3}]

A single-session hatha yoga intervention acutely reduced craving among nicotine-deprived smokers not attempting to reduce or quit, yet it is unknown if it reduces craving among those attempting to change their smoking. Thus, this study tested the efficacy of a single-session hatha yoga intervention for acutely reducing craving among smokers attempting to reduce or quit smoking. Data presented are part of a larger dissertation project. Participants were 55 community-recruited smokers (62% male) motivated to reduce or quit smoking randomized to one session of hatha yoga (n = 25) or wellness control (ie, reading educational materials about healthy lifestyle; n = 30) on their intervention day (ie, the day on which they began to reduce or quit smoking). Participants rated, ""I have a desire for a cigarette right now,"" on a 7-point Likert scale immediately before and after the intervention. After statistically controlling for CO in breath, participant type, age, gender, race, and ethnicity, a significant Time × Condition interaction was found, F(1, 47) = 4.72, p = .035, ηp2 = .09, suggesting craving decreased at a greater rate in the hatha yoga condition relative to the wellness condition. Results from this study add to a growing body of research demonstrating the potential clinical utility of hatha yoga as an adjunctive intervention tool for smoking cessation. This is the first known study to test the impact of a single-session hatha yoga intervention on craving among adult smokers attempting to reduce or quit smoking. We found that 30 minutes of hatha yoga produced a greater reduction in craving compared to a 30-minute wellness control condition. This relationship was evident even after statistically accounting for other important variables (eg, gender). Results of this study add to a growing body of literature demonstrating the potential clinical utility of hatha yoga as an adjunctive intervention strategy for smoking cessation."|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'craving', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'yoga', 'out': 'craving', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}]

However, the uptake of exercise is limited in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis. To address the gap, we designed a gamified non-weight-bearing intradialytic exercise program (exergame). The intradialytic exergame is virtually supervised based on its interactive feedback via wearable sensors attached on lower extremities. We examined the effectiveness of this program to reduce depression symptoms compared to nurse-supervised intradialytic exercise in 73 hemodialysis patients (age = 64.5 ± 8.7years, BMI = 31.6 ± 7.6kg/m 2 ). Participants were randomized into an exergame group (EG) or a supervised exercise group (SG). Both groups received similar exercise tasks for 4 weeks, with three 30 min sessions per week, during hemodialysis treatment. Depression symptoms were assessed at baseline and the fourth week using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Both groups showed a significant reduction in depression score (37%, p < 0.001, Cohen's effect size d = 0.69 in EG vs. 41%, p < 0.001, d = 0.65 in SG) with no between-group difference for the observed effect ( p > 0.050). The EG expressed a positive intradialytic exercise experience including fun, safety, and helpfulness of sensor feedback. Together, results suggested that the virtually supervised low-intensity intradialytic exergame is feasible during routine hemodialysis treatment. It also appears to be as effective as nurse-supervised intradialytic exercise to reduce depression symptoms, while reducing the burden of administrating exercise on dialysis clinics.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'depression', 'dis': 'Depression', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'virtual reality', 'out': 'depression', 'dis': 'Depression', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'exergaming', 'out': 'depression', 'dis': 'Depression', 'eff': 3}]

This in turn results in imbalance leading to the diabetic patients' daily activity disparity. The present investigation was conducted to specifically study the effects of combined training (resistance-aerobic) on serum kinesin-1 and physical function in type 2 diabetes patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. 24 diabetic neuropathic females were randomly to be selected out and divided into two experimental and control groups. The experimental group received resistance-aerobic training for 3 sessions during eight weeks. The exercise training included resistance exercises with 2-3 sets, 6-7 exercise stations, 8-12 repetitions (reps), and 3-5 minutes of rest in between the exercises, and the aerobic exercises contained 50-65% of heart rate reserve (HRR) for 3 minutes with 30 seconds of rest interval between sets and 5-10 repetitions. Results show that the serum kinesin-1 level and aerobic endurance declined after eight weeks of combined (resistance-aerobic) exercise training, but this decrease was not significant. The upper body strength increased but it was not significant, while the lower body showed a significant strength increase. With regard to the progressive nature of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, it seems that even the little changes resulting from the combined exercise training can be useful. Nevertheless, more research is required in this area.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'endurance', 'dis': 'Diabetes', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Diabetes', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'muscle strength', 'dis': 'Diabetes', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'endurance', 'dis': 'Diabetes', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Diabetes', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'muscle strength', 'dis': 'Diabetes', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'endurance', 'dis': 'Diabetes', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Diabetes', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'muscle strength', 'dis': 'Diabetes', 'eff': 1}]

However, the rate of adherence to physical exercise is very low among breast cancer survivors (BCS). This study investigated the effects of high supervision ratio resistance training (RT), once a week for 8 weeks, on changes in body composition and muscular strength in BCS. Methods: Twenty-five female BCS undergoing hormone therapy were randomized into resistance training group (TG, n = 12) or control (CG, n = 13) group. The TG performed 8 weeks of supervised RT, with 1 trainer per volunteer, once a week. Body composition was evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and muscle strength was evaluated by 10 repetition maximum (10 RM) for leg press (45°) and bench press exercises. A 1-way analysis of variance was used to compare within-group effects at pre- and post-intervention. An analysis of covariance test was used to compare post-intervention values, using pre-intervention measures as covariates. The effect size (ES) was calculated by Cohen's d . Results: The TG improved muscle strength in 10 RM leg press (45°; Δ 33.75 ± 11.51 kg, P = .02; ES = 0.96) and bench press (Δ 4.08 ± 1.83 kg, P = .01; ES = 1.15). Adherence to training was more than 99%. Changes in body composition were not detected. There were no changes in the CG for any assessment. Conclusion: Once-weekly supervised RT could be an alternative to increase the adherence to exercise and improve muscular strength in BCS.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'muscle strength', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'adherence', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'strength', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'muscle strength', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'adherence', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}]

A crossover randomised cluster trial was conducted, which comprised 1434 children (4-7 years old) from 21 schools in the provinces of Cuenca and Ciudad Real in the Castilla-La Mancha region of Spain. The intervention consisted of three 60 min sessions/week on weekdays between October 2013 and May 2014. Changes in anthropometric variables, physical fitness and BP parameters were measured. The analyses used were mixed regression models to adjust for baseline covariates under cluster randomisation. There was no significant improvement in overweight/obesity with the intervention compared with the control group in both sexes. Further, the intervention did not alter other adiposity indicators or BP parameters. Improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness were seen in girls (1.19; 95% CI 0.31 to 2.08; p=0.008), but not in boys. Finally, there was an improvement in velocity/agility in both girls (-2.51 s; 95% CI -3.98 to -1.05; p=0.001) and boys (-2.35 s; 95% CI -3.71 to -0.98; p=0.001), and in muscular strength in both girls (0.66; 95% CI 0.03 to 1.28; p=0.038) and boys (1.26; 95% CI 0.03 to 1.28; p<0.001).

This study was a pre-registered randomised crossover study. Participants were blinded to the study hypothesis. Participants (N=21) performed a single session of high load isometric resistance exercise or dynamic resistance exercise, in a randomised order separated by a 7-day washout period. Outcomes were assessed before, immediately after, and 45min post-exercise. The primary outcome was pain intensity scored on a numeric pain rating scale (NRS; 0-10) during a pain-provoking single leg decline squat (SLDS). Secondary outcomes were pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) locally, distally and remotely, as well as tendon thickness. There was a significant decrease in pain NRS scores (mean reduction 0.9, NRS 95%CI 0.1-1.7; p=0.028), and increase in PPTs at the tibialis anterior muscle (mean increase 34kPa 95%CI 9.5-58.5; p=0.009) immediately post-exercise. These were not sustained 45min post-exercise for pain (NRS) or PPTs (p>0.05). There were no differences between exercise on any outcome. While patients with patellar tendinopathy decreased pain during SLDS in response to resistance training, but the magnitude was small. Contraction mode may not be the most important factor in determining the magnitude of pain relieving effects. Similarly, there were only small increases in PPTs at the tibialis anterior which were not superior for isometric exercise.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'pain intensity', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'pain intensity', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 1}]

Compared to moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT), high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is considered a time-efficient exercise strategy for cardiometabolic health. We compared the effects of HIIT and MICT on epicardial fat thickness (EFT) and endothelial function in patients with hypertensive MS.               Methods:             In total, 34 participants with hypertensive MS (mean age: 50.9 ± 7.9 years) were randomized to either the HIIT ( n = 17) or MICT ( n = 17) group. In the HIIT group, participants performed for 3 min at 40% heart-rate reserve (HRR), which was alternated with 3 min at 80% HRR, whereas participants in the MICT group performed at 60% of HRR thrice a week for 8 weeks. EFT was measured with echocardiography, and endothelial function was determined by quantifying endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), nitric oxide (NO), and flow-mediated dilation (FMD).               Results:             After exercise training, patients in both the groups showed significantly decreased EFT ( P < 0.001 and P < 0.01) and improved FMD ( P < 0.001 and P < 0.01). NO ( P < 0.05) and EPCs (CD34/KDR, P < 0.01; CD34/CD117, P < 0.05; CD34/CD133, P < 0.05) were significantly improved in the HIIT group, but not in the MICT group. In addition, HIIT had a greater effect than MICT on FMD (group difference, P < 0.05) and EFT (group difference, P < 0.05).               Conclusions:             Compared to MICT, HIIT seems to better improve FMD and EFT. This finding suggests that HIIT could be more effective than MICT in improving endothelial function in patients with hypertensive MS.|[{'npi': 'endurance training', 'out': 'endothelial dysfunction', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'endurance training', 'out': 'metabolic syndrome', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 1}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'metabolic syndrome', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'endothelial dysfunction', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'metabolic syndrome', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 2}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'endothelial dysfunction', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 2}]

However, it is unclear whether cognitive impairment during high-intensity exercise is associated with reduced CBF. We tested the hypothesis that a reduction in CBF is responsible for impaired cognitive performance during high-intensity exercise. Using a randomized crossover design 17 healthy males performed spatial delayed response and Go/No-Go tasks in three conditions (exercise [EX], exercise+CO2 [EX+CO2], and a nonexercising control [CON]). In the EX and EX+CO2, they performed cognitive tasks at rest and during 8 min of moderate and high-intensity exercise. Exercise intensity corresponded to ~50% (moderate) and ~80% (high) of peak oxygen uptake. In the EX+CO2, the participants inspired hypercapnic gas (2% CO2) during high-intensity exercise. In the CON, they performed the cognitive tasks without exercise. Middle cerebral artery mean velocity increased during high-intensity exercise in the EX+CO2 relative to the EX (69.4 [10.6] cm·s, vs 57.2 [7.7] cm·s, P < 0.001). Accuracy of the cognitive tasks was impaired during high-intensity exercise in the EX (84.1% [13.3%], P < 0.05) and the EX+ CO2 (85.7 [11.6%], P < 0.05) relative to rest (EX: 95.1% [5.3%], EX+CO2: 95.1 [5.3%]). However, no differences between the EX and the EX+CO2 were observed (P > 0.10). These results demonstrate that restored CBF did not prevent cognitive impairment during high-intensity exercise. We conclude that a reduction in CBF is not responsible for impaired cognitive performance during high-intensity exercise.|[{'npi': 'high-intensity interval training', 'out': 'cognitive performance', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 2}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'cognitive performance', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 2}]

To investigate the effectiveness of high intensity exercises on disease activity in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). Assessor blinded multicentre randomised controlled trial. 100 patients (aged from their 20s to their 60s) with axSpA were randomly assigned to an exercise group or to a no-intervention control group. The exercise group performed cardiorespiratory and muscular strength exercises at high intensity over 3 months. The control group received standard care and was instructed to maintain their usual physical activity level. Primary outcome was disease activity measured with the Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) Disease Activity Scale (ASDAS, higher score=worst) and the Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI, 0-10, 10=worst). Secondary outcomes were inflammatory markers, physical function and cardiovascular (CV)-health. There was patient involvement in the design and reporting of this study. 97 of the 100 (97%) randomised patients completed the measurements after the intervention. There was a significant treatment effect of the intervention on the primary outcome (ASDAS: -0.6 [-0.8 to -0.3], p<0.001 and BASDAI: -1.2 [-1.8 to -0.7], p<0.001). Significant treatment effects were also seen for inflammation, physical function and CV-health.

A total of 265 participants were included in one of two randomized clinical trials. Participants had been sick listed 2-12 months with a musculo-skeletal, psychological, or general/unspecified diagnosis. We measured PA by questionnaires at the start of the programs and at 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. Between-group differences in PA were assessed using linear mixed models. Associations between change in PA and future work outcomes were assessed by logistic and linear regression. There was no difference in change in PA between the inpatient and outpatient programs during 12 months of follow-up. We did not find any associations between the amount of PA and future work outcomes. However, intensity of PA was positively associated with return to work (RTW); participants reporting increased vigorous PA had an odds ratio (OR) for RTW of 4.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-15.7) whereas participants reporting consistently high intensity of PA had an OR of 3.1 (95% CI 1.0-9.7), compared to participants reporting low-intensity PA. Inpatient occupational rehabilitation, including PA, did not increase PA-level in the follow-up period more than a less comprehensive program without PA. The amount of PA was not associated with future work outcomes. However, vigorous PA showed a positive association with RTW.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'return to work', 'dis': 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'eff': 2}]

This study is a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a specialized adapted yoga program on anxiety and depression for high-risk expectant mothers on bedrest in a hospital setting. Seventy-nine pregnant subjects on physician ordered hospitalized bedrest were randomized into two groups: receiving biweekly yoga sessions (intervention group) or receiving no yoga (control group). Data collection tool was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess outcomes after delivery. Yoga, even as little as three sessions, showed significant impact in reducing anxiety and depression high-risk pregnant women on hospitalized bedrest. Perceived anxiety and depression overall scores were lower in the intervention group than in the control group (p < 0.001). Results demonstrated that yoga is an effective intervention to decrease anxiety and depression in high-risk antepartum women on hospitalized bedrest.|[{'npi': 'yoga', 'out': 'anxiety', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'yoga', 'out': 'anxiety', 'dis': 'Depression', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'yoga', 'out': 'depression', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'yoga', 'out': 'depression', 'dis': 'Depression', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'anxiety', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'anxiety', 'dis': 'Depression', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'depression', 'dis': 'Anxiety', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'depression', 'dis': 'Depression', 'eff': 3}]

[Participants and Methods] We gathered data from 41 middle-aged and older people (age 65.0 ± 11.7 years). Participants were randomly divided into five groups: (1) 15 minutes of low intensity aerobic training (n=10); (2) 30 minutes of low intensity training (n=7); (3) 15 minutes of moderate-intensity training (n=9); (4) 30 minutes of moderate-intensity training (n=8); and (5) a non-training group (n=7). Training was conducted for 8 weeks, three times per week. Arterial pulse wave index, arterial pressure-volume index, brachial-ankle and heart-brachial pulse wave velocity, cardio-ankle vascular index, brachial and ankle blood pressure, heart rate, and peak oxygen uptake were measured before and after the intervention. [Results] All indicators of arterial stiffness and brachial and ankle blood pressure in the exercise groups were significantly lower after versus before the intervention. Peak oxygen uptake did not differ before versus after the intervention. [Conclusion] The present findings indicate that regular aerobic exercise may be important in reducing arterial stiffness regardless of the intensity or duration of aerobic exercise.|[{'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'blood pressure', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'vascular stiffness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'blood pressure', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'vascular stiffness', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}]

Participants were 28 healthy female volunteers, aged 18-28 years, randomly assigned to an experimental group and a placebo group. They were characterized by a sociodemographic questionnaire, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and the Food Frequency Questionnaire. The groups performed four sessions of abdominal radiofrequency followed by moderate aerobic exercise, assessing body mass, body mass index, fat mass, waist circumference, waist/height ratio, subcutaneous adipose thickness, and horizontal abdominal adipose fold at the first and fourth sessions. In the experimental group, a percentage of potency was used that allowed to maintain the temperature between 40°C and 42°C to the epidermis. In the placebo group, the power of the radiofrequency was 0 W. To compare results, Student's t test was used for a significance level of 0.05. There was a statistically significant decrease in waist circumference, abdominal subcutaneous adipose thickness, and horizontal abdominal fold in the experimental group compared to the placebo group (P < 0.05). Combined exercise intervention with radiofrequency has been shown to be effective in reducing abdominal adiposity.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'fat mass', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'fat mass', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'intra-abdominal fat', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'body mass index', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'intra-abdominal fat', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'body mass index', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}]

Randomized controlled trial. Sixty-four female patients who were diagnosed with fibromyalgia syndrome based on the American College of Rheumatology criteria were recruited (mean age: 54.27 ± 6.94 years). The control group ( n = 32) underwent supervised moderate-intensity cycling (50%-70% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate) three times per week for 12 weeks. The experimental group ( n = 32) underwent the same exercise programme plus a stretching programme once per week for 12 weeks. The main measures of this study were sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the impact of fibromyalgia on quality of life assessed by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, and pain perception assessed by the visual analogue scale at baseline, after 4 weeks, and after 12 weeks. The experimental group experienced significant improvements at 4-week measure compared with control group: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( P < 0.001); Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( P = 0.002); Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (0.93 ± 7.39, P < 0.001); and visual analogue scale (0.52 ± 0.05, P < 0.001). Also at 12-week measure, experimental group experienced significant improvements compared with control group: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( P < 0.001), Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( P < 0.001); Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (1.15 ± 9.11, P < 0.001); and visual analogue scale (0.81 ± 0.62, P < 0.001). Adding stretching to a moderate-intensity aerobic exercise programme increased sleep quality, decreased the impact of fibromyalgia on the quality of life, and reduced pain compared with just a moderate-intensity aerobic exercise programme in our sample of women with fibromyalgia.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'sleep quality', 'dis': 'Fibromyalgia', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Fibromyalgia', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'myalgia', 'dis': 'Fibromyalgia', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'sleep quality', 'dis': 'Fibromyalgia', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Fibromyalgia', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'muscle stretching exercises', 'out': 'myalgia', 'dis': 'Fibromyalgia', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'sleep quality', 'dis': 'Fibromyalgia', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'pain', 'dis': 'Fibromyalgia', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'myalgia', 'dis': 'Fibromyalgia', 'eff': 3}]

To our knowledge, the association of aerobic exercise on an exercise bicycle with CPAP has not yet been demonstrated. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of physical exercise on a cycle ergometer combined with CPAP in the postoperative period after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. This was a randomized clinical trial, with recruitment from May 2017 to December 2017 (registered in the Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry: RBR-69CDYF). The step group ( n = 16 subjects) started rehabilitation in the immediate postoperative period with breathing exercises and passive mobilization in the sitting position, progressing to active exercises, ambulation, and stair training. For the intervention group ( n = 15 subjects), dynamic exercises on a cycle ergometer combined with CPAP were added to the step program from the second to the fourth postoperative day in a single daily session. Functional capacity decreased in both groups, but this reduction was not significant in the intervention group ( P = .11). The length of stay in ICU was lower in the intervention group ( P = .050). In both groups there was a decrease in maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressure, as well as in the 1-min sit-to-stand test on the fourth postoperative day compared to the preoperative period. Physical exercise combined with CPAP promoted the maintenance of functional capacity and reduced the length of stay in the ICU.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'physical functioning', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'physical functioning', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'aerobic exercise', 'out': 'rehabilitation', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}]

For this, 11 recreationally resistance-trained males performed 2 randomized trials: moderate-load (6 sets at 70% 1-repetition maximum (1RM) and a 90-s rest interval between sets) and high-load (6 sets at 90% 1RM and a 180-s rest interval between sets) leg-press exercise until movement failure. The subjective rating of hunger was obtained through a visual analog scale. Glucose and lactate concentration were evaluated at rest, immediately after exercise, and 30 min after exercise. Heart rate variability was recorded at baseline and during recovery (until 30 min after exercise) to assess autonomic modulation. The moderate-load condition induced lower subjective hunger ratings than the strength condition immediately after exercise (19.7 ± 16.6 vs 47.3 ± 27.7 mm), 30 min after exercise (33.6 ± 22.9 vs 58.5 ± 29.9 mm), and 60 min after exercise (43.8 ± 26.6 vs 67.8 ± 27.9 mm) ( p < 0.05) and lower area under the curve hunger in relation to the high-load condition ( p < 0.006). Moderate-load RE presented greater lactate concentration and induced slower heart rate variability recovery in relation to high-load RE ( p < 0.05), but no difference was found in glucose, as well as no correlations between any of the variables investigated. In conclusion, moderate-load RE induced lower subjective hunger ratings, slower recovery of the parasympathetic nervous system, and higher lactate concentration in relation to high-load RE, but the metabolic variables were not correlated with hunger suppression.|[{'npi': 'physical activity', 'out': 'heart rate variability', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'resistance training', 'out': 'heart rate variability', 'dis': 'Undefined', 'eff': 3}]

Bayesian multilevel modeling showed that self-reported physical activity did not predict changes in cognitive function. Physical activity positively predicted cognitive performance at baseline, and the relations were stronger for more active (compared to less active) older adults. Physical activity had a positive within-person effect on cognitive function. The within-person effect of physical activity on episodic memory recall was stronger for participants who on average engaged in less physical activity. The within-person effect on verbal fluency was stronger for participants with more education.

Its antioxidants have the capacity to destroy free radicals that damage cells and increase risk of inflammatory conditions such as metabolic syndrome, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. This review synthesizes findings from animal studies and clinical trials to assess effectiveness of hibiscus for treating biomarkers of metabolic syndrome including hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein, obesity, and hypertension. We searched for 12 edible species of hibiscus in the Google Scholar database. Each scientific name of these species, their common names and their edible plant parts were searched in conjunction with fourteen key words associated with metabolic syndrome. A total of 68 articles met all inclusion criteria for this review, including 18 that tested human subjects, 48 that tested other animals, one that tested humans and other animals, and one that did not specify. Hibiscus often improved blood glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, weight, lipid absorption and oxidation of fatty acids within vital organs around the abdominal cavity. Higher doses led to greater benefits in some cases, especially for body mass of animals, but lower doses were often equally effective. Hibiscus was often equally or more effective than pharmaceuticals in improving some biomarkers of metabolic syndrome, especially blood glucose and insulin sensitivity. Hibiscus shows great promise for improving biomarkers of metabolic syndrome, but there are limitations that need to be addressed by future work, including increasing the number and size of human clinical trials, expanding human trials to include people from a greater diversity of ethnicities, taking into account the health and physical activity of human participants, investigating the influence of growing conditions and extraction/preparation techniques on nutrients in hibiscus, comparing the efficacy of several plant parts and plant products of hibiscus to a reference control group within the same experiment, incorporating rigorous statistical analysis of treatments and investigating the influence of dosage.|[{'npi': 'hibiscus', 'out': 'cholesterol', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'hibiscus', 'out': 'blood pressure', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'hibiscus', 'out': 'blood pressure', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'hibiscus', 'out': 'insulin resistance', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'hibiscus', 'out': 'insulin resistance', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'hibiscus', 'out': 'insulin resistance', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'hibiscus', 'out': 'glycemic control', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'hibiscus', 'out': 'glycemic control', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'phytotherapy', 'out': 'blood pressure', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'phytotherapy', 'out': 'blood pressure', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'phytotherapy', 'out': 'blood pressure', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'phytotherapy', 'out': 'blood glucose', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'phytotherapy', 'out': 'insulin resistance', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'phytotherapy', 'out': 'insulin resistance', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'phytotherapy', 'out': 'insulin resistance', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'phytotherapy', 'out': 'glycemic control', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'phytotherapy', 'out': 'glycemic control', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'phytotherapy', 'out': 'cholesterol', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'phytotherapy', 'out': 'cholesterol', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'phytotherapy', 'out': 'cholesterol', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'phytotherapy', 'out': 'metabolic syndrome', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'phytotherapy', 'out': 'metabolic syndrome', 'dis': 'Overweight', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'hibiscus', 'out': 'blood glucose', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'hibiscus', 'out': 'blood glucose', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'hibiscus', 'out': 'blood pressure', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'phytotherapy', 'out': 'blood glucose', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'phytotherapy', 'out': 'blood glucose', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'phytotherapy', 'out': 'glycemic control', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'phytotherapy', 'out': 'metabolic syndrome', 'dis': 'Cardiovascular diseases', 'eff': 3}, {'npi': 'hibiscus', 'out': 'glycemic control', 'dis': 'Cancer', 'eff': 3}]
